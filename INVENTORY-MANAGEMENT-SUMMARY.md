# Ice Cream Inventory Management - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What We've Added

### üì¶ Inventory Management Features

The inventory page now has full CRUD operations through **transactions** (following HERA's universal architecture):

### 1. **New Production** (Green Button)
- Creates new production batch transactions
- Adds inventory to the Main Production Plant
- Automatically sets:
  - Batch number
  - Production date
  - Expiry date (based on product shelf life)
  - Quality status

### 2. **Stock Transfer** (Blue Button)
- Transfers inventory between locations
- Select source and destination locations
- Creates inventory_transfer transactions
- Automatically updates stock levels at both locations

### 3. **Inventory Adjustment** (Orange Button)
- Handle damage, expiry, theft, quality issues
- Use positive numbers to increase stock
- Use negative numbers to decrease stock
- Reasons available:
  - Damage
  - Expiry
  - Theft/Loss
  - Quality Issue
  - Count Correction

### 4. **Quick Actions per Row**
- Each inventory item has action buttons
- Transfer button pre-fills the current location
- Adjustment button pre-fills product and location

## üèóÔ∏è HERA Universal Architecture Compliance

**NO DIRECT INVENTORY TABLE UPDATES!** Everything is managed through transactions:

```typescript
// Production adds stock
transaction_type: 'production_batch'

// Transfer moves stock between locations
transaction_type: 'inventory_transfer'

// Adjustments increase/decrease stock
transaction_type: 'inventory_adjustment'

// Sales reduce stock (from POS)
transaction_type: 'pos_sale'
```

Stock levels are **calculated** from transaction history, not stored directly.

## üìä How It Works

### Stock Level Calculation
```
Current Stock = 
  + Production Batches
  - Transfers Out
  + Transfers In
  - Sales
  +/- Adjustments
```

### Transaction Flow
1. User performs action (produce, transfer, adjust)
2. System creates a transaction record
3. System creates transaction line with product/quantity
4. Inventory page recalculates stock levels
5. Display updates automatically

## üéØ Business Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every inventory change is tracked
2. **Multi-Location Support**: Stock tracked per location
3. **Batch Tracking**: Know which batch is where
4. **Expiry Management**: Track expiry dates from production
5. **Cost Tracking**: Every transaction has cost implications

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### To Add New Stock:
1. Click "New Production" button
2. Select product and quantity
3. Stock is added to Main Production Plant

## üîí Security

This implementation demonstrates how HERA's universal architecture handles complex inventory management without custom tables or direct CRUD operations!
