## Implementation Guide

### 1. Basic Setup

```typescript
import { universalCashflowAPI } from '@/lib/cashflow/cashflow-engine'

// Generate direct method statement
const statement = await universalCashflowAPI.generateCashflowStatement({
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31',
  method: 'direct',
  currency: 'AED'
})
```

### 2. Setup Demo Data

```typescript
import { setupHairSalonCashflowDemo } from '@/lib/cashflow/demo-data-generator'

// Complete salon demo setup
const demoResult = await setupHairSalonCashflowDemo('org-123')
console.log(`Created ${demoResult.transactions_created} transactions`)
```

### 3. Dashboard Integration

```typescript
import CashflowDashboard from '@/components/cashflow/CashflowDashboard'

<CashflowDashboard organizationId="org-123" currency="AED" />
```

## Universal API Integration

The cashflow system extends the universal API with dedicated functions:

```typescript
// Generate statements
await universalApi.generateCashflowStatement({
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31',
  method: 'direct'
})

// Create forecasts
await universalApi.generateCashflowForecast({
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  forecastMonths: 12,
  baselineMonths: 6
})

// Analyze trends
await universalApi.analyzeCashflowTrends({
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  periods: 6
})

// Setup demo
await universalApi.setupHairSalonCashflowDemo('org-123')
```

## Cashflow Classification Logic

### Transaction Analysis Flow:
1. **Smart Code Analysis**: Primary classification based on HERA smart codes
2. **Transaction Type**: Secondary classification by transaction type
3. **GL Account Mapping**: Tertiary classification by account codes
4. **Amount Analysis**: Cash impact determination (inflow/outflow)
5. **Industry Rules**: Apply business-specific classification rules

### Classification Rules:

**Operating Activities** (Revenue-producing activities):
- Service revenue and product sales
- Payments to suppliers and employees
- Tax payments and interest payments
- General business expenses

**Investing Activities** (Long-term asset transactions):
- Property, plant, and equipment purchases/sales
- Investment acquisitions/disposals
- Capital expenditures and improvements

**Financing Activities** (Equity and debt transactions):
- Loan proceeds and repayments
- Owner contributions and withdrawals
- Dividend payments and equity transactions
