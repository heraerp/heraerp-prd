# Authentication & Role Display Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Issues Resolved:** 2 critical authentication issues

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Owner Login Loading Receptionist Dashboard**
**Problem:** Users with `ORG_OWNER` role in database were being redirected to receptionist dashboard

**Root Cause:**
- API returns HERA RBAC roles: `ORG_OWNER`, `ORG_ADMIN`, `ORG_EMPLOYEE`
- Salon-access page expected simple roles: `owner`, `manager`, `receptionist`
- No mapping between HERA RBAC roles and salon roles

**Solution:** Added role mapping in `/src/app/salon-access/page.tsx` lines 257-268:

```typescript
// Map HERA RBAC roles (ORG_OWNER, ORG_ADMIN, ORG_EMPLOYEE) to salon roles
const roleMapping: Record<string, string> = {
  'org_owner': 'owner',
  'org_admin': 'manager',
  'org_manager': 'manager',
  'org_accountant': 'accountant',
  'org_employee': 'receptionist',
  'owner': 'owner',
  'manager': 'manager',
  'receptionist': 'receptionist',
  'accountant': 'accountant',
  'member': 'receptionist'
}

const normalizedRaw = String(roleFromDB).toLowerCase().trim()
roleFromDB = roleMapping[normalizedRaw] || normalizedRaw
```

### **Issue 2: Welcome Message Shows "ORG_OWNER" Instead of Friendly Name**
**Problem:** Login success message showed raw database role: "You are signed in as ORG_OWNER"

**Solution:** Added enterprise-grade display names in `/src/app/salon-access/page.tsx` lines 353-363:

```typescript
// 🎯 Enterprise-grade role display names
const roleDisplayNames: Record<string, string> = {
  'owner': 'Salon Owner',
  'manager': 'Salon Manager',
  'receptionist': 'Front Desk',
  'accountant': 'Accountant',
  'stylist': 'Stylist'
}

const displayName = roleDisplayNames[userRole] || 'Team Member'
setMessage(`🎉 Welcome! Signing you in as ${displayName}...`)
```

**Before:** `🎉 Welcome! You are signed in as ORG_OWNER`
**After:** `🎉 Welcome! Signing you in as Salon Owner...`

---

## 🔧 Additional Fix: Dashboard Redirect Issue

### **Issue 3: Dashboard Redirecting to Sign-In Page**
**Problem:** After successful login, navigating to `/salon/dashboard` would redirect back to sign-in

**Root Cause:** `HERAAuthProvider` had overly aggressive caching logic that prevented re-resolution when organization context was incomplete

**Solution:** Modified `/src/components/auth/HERAAuthProvider.tsx` lines 154-159:

```typescript
// OLD: Would return early even if organization was missing
if (session && ctxRef.current.user) {
  console.log('✅ Session and context both valid, no re-resolution needed')
  return
}

// NEW: Check for organization before returning
if (session && !ctxRef.current.user) {
  console.log('🔄 Session exists but context missing, re-resolving...')
  didResolveRef.current = false
} else if (session && ctxRef.current.user && !ctxRef.current.organization) {
  // ✅ NEW: Allow re-resolution if organization is missing
  console.log('🔄 Session and user exist but organization missing, re-resolving...')
  didResolveRef.current = false
} else {
  console.log('✅ Session and context both valid, no re-resolution needed')
  return
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### **Test Case 1: Owner Login**
```
✅ Email: Hairtalkz2022@gmail.com
✅ Database Role: ORG_OWNER
✅ Mapped Role: owner
✅ Display Message: "Welcome! Signing you in as Salon Owner..."
✅ Redirect: /salon/dashboard
```

### **Test Case 2: Receptionist Login**
```
✅ Email: hairtalkz01@gmail.com
✅ Database Role: ORG_EMPLOYEE
✅ Mapped Role: receptionist
✅ Display Message: "Welcome! Signing you in as Front Desk..."
✅ Redirect: /salon/receptionist
```

### **Test Case 3: Dashboard Navigation**
```
✅ User logs in successfully
✅ Navigate to /salon/dashboard
✅ Dashboard loads without redirecting
✅ Organization context properly resolved
```

## 🔍 Debug Logging

The fixes include comprehensive logging for troubleshooting:

```typescript
console.log('✅ Role fetched from database (raw):', rawRole)
console.log('✅ Role after normalization (trimmed, lowercase):', normalizedRaw)
console.log('✅ Role after mapping:', roleFromDB)
console.log('✅ userRole variable set to:', userRole)
console.log('✅ userRole === "owner":', userRole === 'owner')
console.log('✅ userRole === "receptionist":', userRole === 'receptionist')
```
