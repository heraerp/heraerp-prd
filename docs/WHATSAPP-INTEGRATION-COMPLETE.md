## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

1. **Conditional Rendering**: Components only show when relevant
   - Customers: Only if WhatsApp consent is given
   - Payments: Only after successful payment with phone number
   - Services: Only for new services (< 30 days old)

2. **Organization Context**: All components receive organizationId for multi-tenant isolation

3. **Event Callbacks**: Each component has callbacks for tracking
   - `onCampaignCreate`
   - `onCampaignSent`
   - `onSendConfirmation`
   - `onSendReminder`

4. **UI Consistency**: 
   - HERA DNA glassmorphism design
   - Dark theme support
   - Color-coded by notification type
   - Preview dialogs for all messages
