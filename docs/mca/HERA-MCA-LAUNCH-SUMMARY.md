## 🧭 Recommended Next Phase (MCA v2 Roadmap)

### 1️⃣ **Provider Integration Expansion**
- Add push notifications (Firebase / OneSignal)
- Add LinkedIn Ads + Meta Ads connectors  
- Support custom "in-app" channel via same pipeline

### 2️⃣ **Analytics & AI Dashboards**
- `/analytics` page: heatmaps, conversions, segment cohorts
- AI-driven send-time optimization, subject scoring, and look-alike audience modeling
- Emit `AI_RECOMMENDATION_APPLIED` transactions for audit

### 3️⃣ **Automation Journeys**
- Visual workflow builder: triggers (signup, purchase), waits, conditions, send actions
- Reuse existing `crm_dispatch_campaign_v1` per node
- Maintain `JOURNEY_EXECUTED` and `NODE_COMPLETED` transactions

### 4️⃣ **Security & Compliance Layer**
- Automated DPIA generation per campaign/template
- Key rotation and PII encryption audit scripts
- DSR (Data Subject Request) dashboard for admins

### 5️⃣ **Performance & Scaling**
- Async job orchestration (Supabase Queue / Redis streams)
- Caching for compiled segments
- Delivery queue sharding by org and channel
- Automated provider fallback & retry policy

### 6️⃣ **Public API & Developer SDK**
- Publish `/api/v2/mca/*` endpoints in SDK form (TypeScript client + OpenAPI spec)
- Add webhook signing and verification utilities
- Developer sandbox mode with test data seeding
