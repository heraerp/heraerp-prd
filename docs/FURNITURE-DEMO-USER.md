  id: '91dbacdd-3e46-4f40-b75b-f6daa4e4354c',
  organization_id: 'f0af4ced-9d12-4a55-a649-b484368db249',

  entity_code: 'USER-DEMO-001',
  smart_code: 'HERA.FURNITURE.USER.ADMIN.v1',
  metadata: {
    email: 'demo@keralafurniture.com',
    role: 'admin',
    permissions: [
      'furniture:read',
      'furniture:write',
      'furniture:delete',
      'tender:manage',
      'inventory:manage',
      'reports:view'
    ]
  }
}
```

### RLS (Row Level Security)
The demo user's authentication automatically:
- Sets organization context to Kerala Furniture Works
- Applies RLS policies to filter data
- Ensures data isolation between organizations
- Provides access only to authorized data

### Session Management
- Sessions expire after 7 days of inactivity
- Refresh tokens are automatically renewed
- Organization context persists across sessions
- Multi-tab support with shared session

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Testing Tender CRUD Operations**
```typescript
// All operations automatically include organization context
const tender = await universalApi.createEntity({
  entity_type: 'tender',
  entity_name: 'New Tender',
  // organization_id is added automatically from session
})
```

### 2. **Accessing Organization Data**
```typescript
// Queries are automatically filtered by organization
const products = await supabase
  .from('core_entities')
  .select('*')
  .eq('entity_type', 'product')
// Returns only Kerala Furniture Works products
```

### 3. **Creating Transactions**
```typescript
// Transactions include user context
const transaction = await universalApi.createTransaction({
  transaction_type: 'sale',
  // created_by is set from authenticated user
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid login credentials"
- Ensure you're using the exact email and password
- Check for spaces before/after the email
- Password is case-sensitive

### "RLS policy violation"
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check that session is active
- Verify organization context is set

### "No data showing"
- Confirm you're accessing the furniture organization
- Check browser console for errors
- Try logging out and back in

### "Session expired"
- Log in again with demo credentials
- Sessions last 7 days by default
- Check for browser security settings

## Security Notes
