# 💅 Salon Smart Accountant - User Guide

## Overview

The Salon Smart Accountant is a revolutionary AI-powered accounting assistant designed specifically for salon owners who have no accounting knowledge. It transforms complex bookkeeping into simple conversations.

## 🎯 Key Principle: "Just Tell Me What Happened"

- ✅ "Sarah paid 350 for hair coloring" 
- ✅ "Bought hair color for 250 from Beauty Depot"
- ✅ "Pay Maya 40% commission on today's sales"
- ✅ "Show me today's total"

The AI handles all the technical accounting automatically!
