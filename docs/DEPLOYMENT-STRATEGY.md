# üöÄ HERA ERP Deployment Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the complete deployment strategy for HERA ERP to prevent production crashes and ensure smooth releases.

## üìã Environment Structure

### 1. **Development** (Local)
- **Purpose**: Active development and testing
- **Branch**: `develop`
- **URL**: `localhost:3000`
- **Database**: Local Supabase or dev database

### 2. **Staging** (Railway)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Branch**: `staging` or `develop`
- **URL**: `staging.heraerp.com`
- **Database**: Staging Supabase instance
- **Auto-deploy**: On push to `develop`/`staging` branches

### 3. **Production** (Railway)
- **Purpose**: Live application
- **Branch**: `main`
- **URL**: `app.heraerp.com`, `*.heraerp.com`
- **Database**: Production Supabase
- **Deploy**: Manual approval or on merge to `main`

## üîÑ Deployment Workflow

### Standard Development Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Local Dev] -->|git push| B[develop branch]
    B -->|Auto Deploy| C[Staging]
    C -->|Tests Pass| D[Create PR to main]
    D -->|Code Review| E[Merge to main]
    E -->|Manual Approval| F[Production]
    F -->|Health Check| G[Live]
    G -->|Failure| H[Auto Rollback]
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **Local Development**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make changes
# ... code ...

# Test locally
npm run dev
npm run build  # Ensure it builds

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"

# Push to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/your-feature
git push origin develop
```

#### 2. **Staging Deployment** (Automatic)
```bash
# Push to develop triggers staging deployment
git push origin develop

# GitHub Actions will:
# ‚úÖ Run linting
# ‚úÖ Run type checks
# ‚úÖ Build application
# ‚úÖ Deploy to staging
# ‚úÖ Run smoke tests
# ‚úÖ Health checks

# Monitor at: https://staging.heraerp.com
```

#### 3. **Production Deployment** (Controlled)
```bash
# Option A: Via Pull Request (Recommended)
1. Create PR from develop to main
2. Request code review
3. Merge after approval
4. GitHub Actions auto-deploys to production

# Option B: Manual Deployment
gh workflow run production-deployment.yml -f confirm=deploy

# Option C: Railway CLI
railway up --environment production
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Pre-deployment Checks

### Automated Checks (GitHub Actions)

1. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint validation
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Import validation

2. **Build Test**
   - Production build
   - Bundle size check
   - Asset optimization

3. **Smoke Tests**
   - Homepage loads
   - API endpoints respond
   - Auth flow works
   - Database connectivity

### Manual Checks

Before production deployment:

```bash
# 1. Run pre-deployment script
npm run predeploy

# 2. Test build locally
npm run build
npm run start

# 3. Check for console errors
# Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
# Check browser console for errors

# 4. Test critical user flows
# - Login/logout
# - Create entity
# - View dashboard
# - API calls work
```

---

## üö® Preventing Production Crashes

### 1. **Import Validation**
```bash
# Before committing, check for missing imports
npm run build

# Look for errors like:
# "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/...'"
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Ensure all required env vars are set in Railway:
railway variables

# Required variables:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# - DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID
# - ... (see .env.example)
```

### 3. **Database Migrations**
```bash
# Always test migrations in staging first
# Apply to staging
# Test thoroughly
# Then apply to production
```

### 4. **Dependency Updates**
```bash
# Update dependencies in staging first
npm update
npm run build
# Deploy to staging
# Test for 24-48 hours
# Then promote to production
```

## üìä Railway Setup Instructions

### Create Staging Environment

1. **In Railway Dashboard:**
   ```
   Project: heraprd
   ‚Üí Environments
   ‚Üí Create New Environment: "staging"
   ```

2. **Clone Production Service:**
   ```
   ‚Üí Services
   ‚Üí heraerp-prd
   ‚Üí Clone to staging environment
   ‚Üí Rename: heraerp-staging
   ```

3. **Configure Staging Domain:**
   ```
   ‚Üí heraerp-staging
   ‚Üí Settings
   ‚Üí Domains
   ‚Üí Add Custom Domain: staging.heraerp.com
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Switch to staging environment
   railway environment --environment staging

   # Set variables (use staging database)
   railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<staging-url>
   railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<staging-key>
   # ... other variables
   ```

### Link Environments to Branches

1. **Staging ‚Üí develop branch:**
   ```
   ‚Üí staging environment
   ‚Üí Settings
   ‚Üí Deploy triggers
   ‚Üí Add branch: develop
   ```

2. **Production ‚Üí main branch:**
   ```
   ‚Üí production environment
   ‚Üí Settings
   ‚Üí Deploy triggers
   ‚Üí Add branch: main
   ‚Üí Enable "Wait for CI to pass"
   ```

## üîê GitHub Secrets Setup

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

```
Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
```

Required secrets:
- `RAILWAY_STAGING_TOKEN` - Railway token for staging
- `RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_TOKEN` - Railway token for production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anon key

To get Railway tokens:
```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Get token for staging
railway environment --environment staging
railway token

# Get token for production
railway environment --environment production
railway token
```

---

## üîß Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback
GitHub Actions will automatically rollback if:
- Health checks fail
- Critical endpoints return errors
- Post-deployment tests fail

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway rollback --environment production

# Or via Railway Dashboard
‚Üí Deployments
‚Üí Select previous successful deployment
‚Üí Redeploy
```

---

## üìà Monitoring & Alerts

### Health Checks
All deployments include automatic health checks:

```bash
# Staging
curl https://staging.heraerp.com/api/health

# Production
curl https://app.heraerp.com/api/health
```

### Railway Logs
```bash
# View staging logs
railway logs --environment staging

# View production logs
railway logs --environment production

# Follow live logs
railway logs --environment production --follow
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Never deploy directly to production**
   - Always go through staging first
   - Test in staging for at least 24 hours

2. **Use feature flags for major changes**
   - Enable features in staging first
   - Gradually roll out to production

3. **Deploy during low-traffic periods**
   - Schedule production deploys during off-peak hours
   - Have team available for monitoring

4. **Keep deployments small**
   - Smaller changes = easier rollback
   - Deploy frequently rather than large batches

5. **Monitor after deployment**
   - Watch logs for 30 minutes after deploy
   - Check error rates and response times
   - Test critical user flows

6. **Communicate deployments**
   - Notify team before production deploy
   - Update changelog
   - Document any breaking changes

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### Production is Down

1. **Immediate rollback**
   ```bash
   railway rollback --environment production
   ```

2. **Check logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs --environment production
   ```

3. **Notify team**
   - Post in team chat
   - Update status page

4. **Fix in staging**
   - Reproduce issue in staging
   - Fix and test
   - Deploy to production when stable

### Database Issues

1. **Check connection**
   ```bash
   railway variables --environment production | grep SUPABASE
   ```

2. **Verify RLS policies**
   - Check Supabase dashboard
   - Ensure policies are active

3. **Restore from backup if needed**
   - Contact Supabase support
   - Restore to known good state
