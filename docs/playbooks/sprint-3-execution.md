# HERA Playbooks - Sprint 3: Execute Playbooks

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement runtime execution engine with comprehensive step orchestration, status tracking, and workflow management

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 3 delivers the complete execution engine for HERA Playbooks, enabling real-time orchestration of complex business workflows with enterprise-grade monitoring, error handling, and performance analytics. The system provides automated step execution, human task management, and comprehensive audit trails.

## ✅ Deliverables Completed

### 1. Playbook Execution Engine (`/src/lib/playbooks/execution/`)

**Core Features**:
- **Asynchronous Orchestration**: Non-blocking execution with real-time status updates
- **Step-by-Step Processing**: Sequential and parallel execution support
- **Worker Management**: Support for human, system, AI, and external workers
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry strategies with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization and recovery mechanisms
- **Checkpoint System**: Execution state preservation for fault tolerance

**Key Components**:
- `PlaybookExecutionEngine` - Core orchestration service
- `StepExecutor` - Individual step execution handler  
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Integration with HERA's universal 6-table architecture

**Execution Flow**:
```typescript
1. Validate input data against playbook contracts
2. Create execution transaction in universal_transactions
3. Process steps sequentially with status tracking
4. Handle worker assignments and task delegation
5. Manage retries and error recovery
6. Update execution status and generate analytics
7. Complete with output data and performance metrics
```

### 2. Step Management System (`/src/app/api/v1/playbooks/[id]/steps/`)

**POST /playbooks/{id}/steps** - Add Step Definitions:
- **Version-Aware Step Creation**: Automatic smart code generation with versioning
- **State Machine Enforcement**: Only draft playbooks accept new steps
- **Automatic Version Creation**: Create new draft version when needed
- **Step Dependencies**: Support for sequential, conditional, and data dependencies
- **Validation & Contracts**: Input/output contracts for each step
- **Relationship Management**: Automatic playbook-step and step-step relationships

**Step Insertion Modes**:
- `append` - Add steps at the end
- `insert` - Insert at specific position with reordering
- `replace` - Replace existing step numbers

**State Machine Rules**:
- **Draft Status**: Fully mutable - can add, remove, reorder steps
- **Active Status**: Immutable - must create new version for changes
- **Deprecated Status**: Immutable - must create new version or reactivate
- **Deleted Status**: Completely immutable

### 3. Playbook Lifecycle Management (`/src/app/api/v1/playbooks/[id]/publish/`)

**PUT /playbooks/{id}/publish** - State Machine Transitions:
- **publish**: draft → active (locks for editing, enables execution)
- **deprecate**: active → deprecated (prevents new executions)
- **reactivate**: deprecated → active (re-enables execution)
- **archive**: any → deleted (permanent removal)

**State Machine Enforcement**:
```typescript
// State transition validation
const transition = validateStateTransition(currentStatus, action);
if (!transition.allowed) {
  return error('Invalid state transition');
}

// Side effects execution
switch (action) {
  case 'publish':
    - Lock playbook for editing
    - Enable execution
    - Validate completeness
  case 'deprecate':
    - Prevent new executions
    - Allow existing executions to complete
}
```

**Publication Validation**:
- Minimum step count verification
- Contract completeness checking
- Dependency validation
- Business rule verification
- Override system for warnings

### 4. Worker Type Support

**System Workers**:
- Automated task execution with configurable timeouts
- Integration with HERA universal APIs
- Resource monitoring and optimization
- Parallel processing capabilities

**Human Workers**:
- Task assignment and notification systems
- Role-based access control for task claiming
- Approval workflows and delegation support
- Time tracking and performance measurement

**AI Workers**:
- Intelligent task processing with confidence scoring
- Multiple AI provider support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Context-aware decision making
- Learning from execution patterns

**External Workers**:
- Third-party service integration
- Webhook and API orchestration
- Authentication and authorization handling
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns

  console.log('Performance Grade:', status.execution_summary.performance_grade);
}
```

### Listing Executions with Filtering
```typescript
const executions = await playbookExecutionEngine.listExecutions({
  playbook_id: 'playbook-123',
  status: 'in_progress',
  limit: 20,
  offset: 0
});

console.log(`Found ${executions.total} executions`);
executions.data.forEach(exec => {
  console.log(`${exec.execution_id}: ${exec.status} (${exec.completed_steps}/${exec.total_steps})`);
});
```

### Canceling an Execution
```typescript
const cancelled = await playbookExecutionEngine.cancelExecution('exec-123');

if (cancelled) {
  console.log('Execution cancelled successfully');
} else {
  console.log('Execution could not be cancelled');
}
```
