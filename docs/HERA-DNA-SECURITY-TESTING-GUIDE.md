# HERA DNA SECURITY Testing Guide üß¨üõ°Ô∏èüß™

**Complete guide for testing the HERA DNA SECURITY framework with the salon module demo users.**

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Demo Users
```bash
# Run the demo user creation script
node scripts/create-salon-demo-users.js
```

This creates 6 demo users with different roles and permissions:

| Role | Email | Password | Access Level |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Owner** | michele@hairtalkz.com | HairTalkz2024! | Full system access |
| **Manager** | manager@hairtalkz.com | Manager2024! | Operational management |
| **Receptionist** | receptionist@hairtalkz.com | Reception2024! | Front desk operations |
| **Stylist** | stylist@hairtalkz.com | Stylist2024! | Own appointments only |
| **Accountant** | accountant@hairtalkz.com | Accounts2024! | Financial data only |
| **Admin** | admin@hairtalkz.com | Admin2024! | System administration |

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access Salon Module
```
http://localhost:3000/salon/auth
```

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Scenarios

4. Verify can only see own appointments/customers
5. Check navigation menu is minimal

### **Scenario 5: Security Violation Testing**
**Test unauthorized access attempts across all roles:**

**Test Steps:**
1. **URL Manipulation Test:**
   - Login as Stylist
   - Try to access `/salon/finance` directly
   - Should redirect or show access denied

2. **API Endpoint Testing:**
   - Use browser dev tools to call financial APIs
   - Should receive 403 Forbidden responses

3. **Component Permission Testing:**
   - Inspect React components for hidden elements
   - Financial data should not be present in DOM

4. **Session Hijacking Test:**
   - Login as Owner, copy session token
   - Try to use token from different organization context
   - Should fail with organization mismatch

## üîí Security Verification Checklist

### **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
- [ ] Users can only see Hair Talkz salon data
- [ ] No data leakage between organizations
- [ ] Organization ID filtering enforced on all queries
- [ ] Session tokens contain correct organization context

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- [ ] Dashboard widgets filtered by role
- [ ] Navigation menu items filtered by role  
- [ ] API endpoints enforce role permissions
- [ ] Financial data masked for unauthorized roles

### **Audit Trail Verification**
- [ ] All login attempts logged
- [ ] Permission checks logged with smart codes
- [ ] Financial data access logged
- [ ] Failed access attempts logged
- [ ] Audit logs contain confidence scores

### **Real-Time Security Monitoring**
- [ ] Security events appear in real-time
- [ ] Failed login attempts trigger alerts
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts flagged
- [ ] Session management working correctly

## üß¨ DNA Component Testing

### **Database Context Testing**
```bash
# Check organization filtering is working
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM core_entities WHERE organization_id != '378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8';
# Should return 0 for Hair Talkz users
```

### **Auth Resolver Testing**
Test JWT validation and organization membership:
- Valid JWT with correct org ‚Üí Access granted
- Valid JWT with wrong org ‚Üí Access denied  
- Expired JWT ‚Üí Redirect to login
- Malformed JWT ‚Üí Access denied

### **Security Middleware Testing**
Test API endpoint protection:
```javascript
// Test API call with different roles
fetch('/api/v2/salon/dashboard', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>' }
})
```

## üéØ Performance Testing

### **Security Overhead Testing**
- [ ] Page load times with security < 200ms additional overhead
- [ ] API response times with security < 50ms additional overhead
- [ ] Database query performance maintained
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable with security context

### **Concurrent User Testing**
- [ ] Multiple users logged in simultaneously
- [ ] No session conflicts between users
- [ ] Role-based data isolation maintained
- [ ] Performance remains stable

## üö® Security Incident Simulation

### **Scenario 1: Insider Threat**
1. Login as Receptionist
2. Attempt to access financial data through multiple vectors:
   - Direct URL access
   - API calls via dev tools
   - Component inspection
   - Local storage manipulation

**Expected:** All attempts blocked and logged

### **Scenario 2: Session Manipulation**
1. Login as valid user
2. Modify session token/cookies
3. Attempt to escalate privileges
4. Try to access other organizations

**Expected:** Session invalidated, access denied

### **Scenario 3: SQL Injection Attempt**
1. Login with malicious input in form fields
2. Try SQL injection patterns in search/filter fields
3. Attempt to bypass organization filtering

**Expected:** Input sanitized, attacks blocked
