## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Organization not found"** → Check DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID in .env
2. **"Smart code invalid"** → Use pattern: HERA.INDUSTRY.MODULE.TYPE.SUBTYPE.v1
3. **"Column not found"** → Check schema with `node check-schema.js`
4. **"Transaction not balanced"** → Ensure debits = credits

### Quick Fixes:
```bash
# Check organization
cd mcp-server && node hera-cli.js query core_organizations

# Verify schema
node check-schema.js [table_name]

# Test connection
node hera-query.js summary
```

## 🚀 Customization Points

### Industry Variables:
```javascript
// Change these for different industries
const INDUSTRY = 'SALON'     // RESTAURANT, HEALTHCARE, RETAIL, etc.
const SERVICES = [...]        // Your service catalog
const EMPLOYEES = [...]       // Your staff list
const GL_ACCOUNTS = [...]     // Industry-specific accounts
```

### Smart Code Patterns:
```
SALON:    HERA.SALON.{MODULE}.{TYPE}.{SUBTYPE}.v1
RESTAURANT: HERA.REST.{MODULE}.{TYPE}.{SUBTYPE}.v1
HEALTHCARE: HERA.HLTH.{MODULE}.{TYPE}.{SUBTYPE}.v1
RETAIL:    HERA.RETAIL.{MODULE}.{TYPE}.{SUBTYPE}.v1
```
