```

## Step 3: Test Rules with Simulation Scenarios

After customizing your rules, test them with real-world scenarios before deployment.

### Testing Interface

The rule tester provides three main features:

#### 1. **Pre-built Test Scenarios**
Ready-to-use scenarios for common business situations:

**For Cancellation Policies:**
- On-time arrival (within grace period)
- Late arrival/No-show scenarios
- Early vs late cancellations
- VIP customer exceptions

**For Pricing Rules:**
- Standard discount requests
- High discount attempts
- Manager overrides
- VIP special pricing

#### 2. **Custom Test Builder**
Create your own test scenarios:
- Select customer tier
- Set appointment/pricing details
- Define custom context
- Run unlimited tests

#### 3. **Test Results Analysis**
- Pass/fail status for each test
- Expected vs actual comparisons
- Detailed diff views
- Overall pass rate metrics

### Example Test Scenarios

#### Cancellation Policy Test
```javascript
// Test: VIP Late Arrival
{
  customer_tier: 'VIP',
  appointment_time: '14:00',
  arrival_time: '14:30',  // 30 min late
  service_price: 150
}
// Expected: 25% fee (VIP exception)
// Actual: 0% fee (your custom rule)
```

#### Pricing Rule Test
```javascript
// Test: Manager Override
{
  customer_tier: 'REGULAR',
  staff_role: 'MANAGER',
  original_price: 200,
  requested_discount_pct: 45
}
// Expected: Allowed
// Actual: Allowed with manager privileges
```

### Testing Workflow

1. **Navigate to Test**: Click "Test Rule" from the rules list
2. **Review Scenarios**: See all pre-built test cases
3. **Run Tests**: Execute individual or all scenarios
4. **Analyze Results**: Review pass/fail metrics
5. **Custom Tests**: Create edge cases specific to your business
6. **Iterate**: Refine rules based on test results

### Benefits of Testing

- **Confidence**: Ensure rules work as expected
- **Edge Cases**: Discover scenarios you hadn't considered
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as rule documentation
- **Regression Prevention**: Re-test after any changes
- **Customer Experience**: Avoid surprises in production

## Step 4: Deploy to Production

After testing your rules, deploy them to production with confidence using the deployment manager.

### Deployment Manager Features

7. **Verify Success**: Check deployment history and confirm activation

### Deployment Best Practices

- **Always Test First**: Ensure 80%+ test pass rate before deployment
- **Document Changes**: Add clear deployment notes for future reference
- **Get Approvals**: For critical rules, require manager sign-off
- **Schedule Wisely**: Deploy during low-traffic periods if possible
- **Monitor Post-Deploy**: Check audit logs after deployment

### Rollback Capability

If issues arise after deployment:
- Access deployment history in the History tab
- Click "Rollback to Previous Version"
- Available for 30 days after deployment
- Maintains complete audit trail

### Example Deployment

```javascript
// Deployment Configuration
{
  scope: {
    apps: ['salon', 'booking_app'],
    locations: ['all']
  },
  schedule: {
    effective_from: '2024-01-15T09:00:00Z',
    effective_to: null  // Permanent deployment
  },
  approvals: [{
    user_id: 'mgr_001',
