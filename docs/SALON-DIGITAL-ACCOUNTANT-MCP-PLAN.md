# 🤖 Salon Digital Accountant MCP Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration plan to make the Digital Accountant accessible for salon owners who don't understand traditional accounting. The system will use natural language processing to automate journal entries, expense recording, and financial management.

## 🎯 Vision: "Accounting Without Knowing Accounting"

Transform complex accounting into simple conversations. Salon owners can speak naturally about their business activities, and the Digital Accountant will handle all the technical accounting behind the scenes.

## 🔧 MCP Tools Implementation

### 1. **Natural Language Transaction Parser**
```typescript
// MCP Tool: parse-salon-transaction
{
  name: 'parse-salon-transaction',
  description: 'Convert natural language to accounting transactions',
  input_schema: {
    message: string,
    context: {
      business_type: 'salon',
      previous_transactions?: Transaction[],
      customer_context?: Customer,
      service_context?: Service
    }
  },
  output: {
    intent: 'expense' | 'revenue' | 'payment' | 'adjustment',
    confidence: number,
    transaction_data: TransactionData,
    journal_entries: JournalEntry[]
  }
}
```

### 2. **Salon-Specific Expense Classifier**
```typescript
// MCP Tool: classify-salon-expense
{
  name: 'classify-salon-expense',
  description: 'Automatically categorize salon expenses',
  categories: {

    'EQUIPMENT': ['dryer', 'chair', 'scissors', 'brushes'],
    'UTILITIES': ['electricity', 'water', 'internet', 'phone'],
    'STAFF': ['salary', 'commission', 'tips', 'training'],

    'MARKETING': ['instagram ads', 'flyers', 'website'],
    'SUPPLIES': ['towels', 'capes', 'gloves', 'foils']
  }
}
```

### 3. **Smart Receipt Scanner**
```typescript
// MCP Tool: scan-receipt
{
  name: 'scan-receipt',
  description: 'Extract data from photos of receipts',
  input: {
    image_url: string,
    organization_id: string
  },
  output: {
    vendor: string,
    amount: number,
    vat_amount: number,
