## Database Architecture

All functions follow HERA's universal 6-table architecture:

- **Staff** â†’ `core_entities` (entity_type: 'staff')
- **Products** â†’ `core_entities` (entity_type: 'product')
- **Commissions** â†’ `universal_transactions` (type: 'commission')
- **Schedules** â†’ `core_relationships` (type: 'scheduled_for')
- **Loyalty Points** â†’ `core_dynamic_data` (field: 'loyalty_points')
- **Packages** â†’ `core_entities` (entity_type: 'service_package')

## Success Metrics

| Function | Current | Target | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Manual scheduling time | 2 hrs/day | 15 min/day | 87% reduction |
| Inventory accuracy | 70% | 95% | 25% improvement |
| Commission calculation | 4 hrs/month | Automatic | 100% time saved |
| Client retention | Unknown | Tracked | Data-driven decisions |
| No-show rate | Unknown | <10% | Revenue protection |

## Next Steps

1. Start with Staff Management using the configuration generator
2. Implement core functions in priority order
3. Test each module with real salon scenarios
4. Gather feedback from salon staff
