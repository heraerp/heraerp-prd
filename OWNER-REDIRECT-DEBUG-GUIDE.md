# Owner Redirect Issue - Debug Guide

## Current Status
Owner (`hairtalkz2022@gmail.com`) is redirecting to `/salon/receptionist` instead of `/salon/dashboard`.

## Investigation Results

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. API correctly returns `roles: ['owner']` from database
2. Receptionist page has owner detection and redirects to dashboard
3. Role normalization logic is in place (`.toLowerCase().trim()`)

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working:
1. Initial redirect from login page goes to receptionist instead of dashboard
2. Login page logs are not appearing in console

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Cached localStorage Role
**Problem:** LocalStorage might have stale `salonRole: 'receptionist'` from a previous session.

**Evidence:**
- SecuredSalonProvider reads `localStorage.getItem('salonRole')` (line 195)
- This cached value might override the fresh API response

**Test:**
```javascript
// Run in browser console
console.log('Cached role:', localStorage.getItem('salonRole'))
```

**Expected:** Should be `'owner'` for hairtalkz2022@gmail.com
**If NOT:** This is the issue!

### Hypothesis 2: Login Page Redirect Logic
**Problem:** The redirect logic in `/src/app/salon-access/page.tsx` might not be executing.

**Evidence:**
- No console logs from login page appearing
- Only see logs from SecuredSalonProvider and hooks
- This suggests either:
  a) Login redirect happened in previous session (page already loaded)
  b) Code is not executing
  c) Fast redirect before logs appear

### Hypothesis 3: Browser Cache
**Problem:** Browser might be serving old JavaScript bundle.

**Evidence:**
- Fast Refresh logs showing rebuilds
- Old code might be cached

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Current State
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('=== CURRENT STATE ===')
console.log('Current URL:', window.location.href)
console.log('salonRole:', localStorage.getItem('salonRole'))
console.log('organizationId:', localStorage.getItem('organizationId'))
console.log('userEmail:', localStorage.getItem('userEmail'))
```

### Step 2: Clear Everything and Test Fresh
```javascript
// 1. Clear localStorage
localStorage.clear()

// 2. Sign out
const { supabase } = await import('@/lib/supabase/client')
await supabase.auth.signOut()

// 3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
// 4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
// 5. Navigate to /salon-access
window.location.href = '/salon-access'
```

### Step 3: Fresh Login Test
1. Enter: `hairtalkz2022@gmail.com`
2. Enter password
3. Click "Sign In"
4. **IMMEDIATELY** open console (F12)
5. Look for these specific logs:

```
Expected Console Output:
üìä Full API response: {...}
üîç DEBUG - Checking role paths
‚úÖ Role fetched from database: owner
‚úÖ Role after normalization: "owner"
üîç === REDIRECT LOGIC START ===
üîç userRole value: owner
üîç normalizedRole after force normalization: owner
üîç normalizedRole === "owner": true
‚úÖ OWNER detected - redirecting to dashboard
üéØ FINAL REDIRECT PATH: /salon/dashboard
üöÄ EXECUTING REDIRECT NOW to: /salon/dashboard
```

**If you DON'T see these logs:**
- Browser cache issue OR
- Already logged in (redirect happened in previous session)

### Step 4: Manual Role Fix (Temporary)
If the issue persists, manually set the correct role:

```javascript
// Force set owner role in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('salonRole', 'owner')
localStorage.setItem('organizationId', '378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8')

// Refresh page
window.location.reload()
```

## Permanent Fix Options

### Option A: Always Trust API Response
Force the login page to ALWAYS use the fresh API role, ignore cache:

```typescript
// In salon-access/page.tsx, after getting role from API
localStorage.setItem('salonRole', roleFromDB)  // Force update

// Clear any cached Zustand state
import { useSalonSecurityStore } from '@/lib/salon/security-store'
const securityStore = useSalonSecurityStore.getState()
securityStore.clearState()
```

### Option B: Clear Cache on Login
Always clear cache when user logs in:

```typescript
// Before redirecting in handleSignIn
localStorage.removeItem('salonRole')  // Clear old role
localStorage.setItem('salonRole', userRole)  // Set fresh role
```

### Option C: Fix SecuredSalonProvider Priority
Change SecuredSalonProvider to prioritize localStorage role over email detection:

```typescript
// In SecuredSalonProvider.tsx getSalonRole()
// Check localStorage FIRST
const storedRole = localStorage.getItem('salonRole')
if (storedRole && ['owner', 'receptionist', 'manager'].includes(storedRole)) {
  console.log('‚úÖ Using role from localStorage:', storedRole)
  return storedRole as SalonSecurityContext['salonRole']
}

// THEN fall back to email detection
if (lowerEmail.includes('2022')) {
  return 'owner'
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User enters credentials on `/salon-access`
2. API returns `roles: ['owner']`
3. Role normalized to `'owner'`
4. localStorage updated: `salonRole = 'owner'`
5. Redirect decision: `normalizedRole === 'owner'` ‚Üí TRUE
6. Redirect to: `/salon/dashboard`
7. Owner dashboard loads directly
8. No intermediate receptionist page

## Verification Steps

After implementing fix:

1. ‚úÖ Clear localStorage completely
2. ‚úÖ Sign out
3. ‚úÖ Clear browser cache
4. ‚úÖ Navigate to `/salon-access`
5. ‚úÖ Login as owner
6. ‚úÖ Should redirect DIRECTLY to `/salon/dashboard`
7. ‚úÖ No flash of receptionist page
8. ‚úÖ Console shows correct redirect logs

## Files to Review

1. `/src/app/salon-access/page.tsx` - Login page with redirect logic (lines 265-314)
2. `/src/app/api/v2/auth/resolve-membership/route.ts` - API returning role (line 121)
3. `/src/app/salon/SecuredSalonProvider.tsx` - Role resolution (lines 664-729)
4. `/src/app/salon/receptionist/page.tsx` - Owner detection redirect (line 37-41)
