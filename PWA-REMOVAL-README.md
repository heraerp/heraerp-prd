# HERA PWA Removal - Complete

## Summary

PWA functionality has been safely removed from HERA to ensure proper multi-tenant data isolation and security. This prevents potential data leakage issues that could occur with offline caching in a multi-tenant SaaS environment.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Kill Switch Service Worker
- **File**: `/public/sw-killswitch.js`
- **Purpose**: Safely unregisters existing service workers and clears all caches
- **Status**: ✅ Created and active

### 2. Updated Service Worker Provider
- **File**: `/src/components/pwa/ServiceWorkerProvider.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed service worker registration
  - Added cleanup functionality to remove existing installations
  - Simplified to stub component that auto-cleans on load
- **Status**: ✅ Updated

### 3. Removed PWA Manifest and Meta Tags
- **File**: `/src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed manifest.json link
  - Removed PWA meta tags
  - Added cache control headers for multi-tenant safety
  - Removed PWA component imports
- **Status**: ✅ Updated

### 4. Stubbed PWA Components
- **Files**: 
  - `/src/components/pwa/AutoUpdateChecker.tsx`
  - `/src/components/pwa/UpdateNotification.tsx`
  - `/src/components/pwa/InstallPrompt.tsx`
- **Changes**: Converted to stub components that return null
- **Status**: ✅ Updated

### 5. Updated Cache Headers
- **File**: `/vercel.json`
- **Changes**: Added strict no-cache headers for multi-tenant safety
- **Status**: ✅ Updated

### 6. Created Clear PWA Helper Page
- **File**: `/public/clear-pwa.html`
- **Purpose**: Helps users manually clear PWA installations
- **Access**: Available at `/clear-pwa.html`
- **Status**: ✅ Created

### 7. Updated Components
- **File**: `/src/components/dashboard/UpdateChecker.tsx`
- **Changes**: Removed service worker references
- **Status**: ✅ Updated

## Files That Can Be Deleted (Optional)

After ensuring all users have cleared their PWA installations, these files can be deleted:
- `/public/sw.js` (old service worker)
- `/public/sw-v2.js` (old service worker v2)
- `/public/manifest.json` (PWA manifest)
- `/public/sw-killswitch.js` (kill switch - keep for 30 days)
- `/public/clear-pwa.html` (helper page - keep for 30 days)

## For Users With Existing PWA Installations

Users who already have HERA installed as a PWA should:
1. Visit `/clear-pwa.html` to remove the PWA
2. Or follow manual removal instructions for their browser
3. Clear browser cache and data for the HERA domain

## Multi-Tenant Safety Benefits

With PWA removed:
- ✅ No offline caching of sensitive data
- ✅ No risk of data leakage between organizations
- ✅ Proper cache control headers enforce fresh data
- ✅ Each organization's data remains properly isolated

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for any issues with existing PWA installations
2. After 30 days, remove the kill switch and helper files
3. Consider implementing organization-specific caching strategies if needed

## Technical Notes

- The kill switch service worker will automatically clean up and unregister itself
- Cache control headers prevent browser caching for multi-tenant safety
- All PWA-related imports have been preserved but stubbed to prevent errors
- The system now relies on standard browser caching with proper headers
