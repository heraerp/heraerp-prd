## Introduction: Leeds - The Digital Heart of Yorkshire

Leeds stands as Yorkshire's commercial capital and the UK's largest financial centre outside London. With a Â£65 billion economy spanning financial services, digital technology, manufacturing, and healthcare, Leeds combines northern grit with global ambition. The city's thriving tech sector, anchored by Sky, ASDA, and countless innovative startups, makes it one of Europe's fastest-growing digital hubs.

But Leeds businesses navigate complex challenges. They must coordinate operations across Yorkshire, balance growth with cost management, attract talent in a competitive market, and modernise while maintaining the operational excellence Yorkshire is known for. Legacy systems that served previous generations can't support the pace and scale of modern Leeds business.

HERA ERP brings enterprise capability without enterprise complexity, perfectly suited to Leeds' blend of ambition and pragmatism.
