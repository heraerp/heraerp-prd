## Introduction: Glasgow's Economic Renaissance

Glasgow has transformed from industrial powerhouse to Scotland's economic engine, driving innovation across financial services, engineering, life sciences, and creative industries. With over 17,000 businesses and the UK's fastest-growing tech sector outside London, Glasgow combines commercial dynamism with renowned Scottish pragmatism. The city's universities produce world-class talent, while its business districts from Merchant City to the International Financial Services District house everything from global corporations to ambitious startups.

Yet Glasgow businesses face unique pressures. They must manage operations across Scotland's central belt, navigate distinct Scottish business regulations, compete internationally while maintaining local employment, and modernise without losing the reliability that defines Scottish commerce. Traditional enterprise systems—expensive, rigid, and slow to implement—don't match Glasgow's entrepreneurial spirit.

HERA ERP delivers enterprise-class capabilities tailored for Glasgow's unique needs, helping businesses scale confidently from the Clyde to the globe.

Glasgow organisations typically battle:

A Glasgow engineering firm recently described their situation: "We design cutting-edge renewable energy systems but ran our business on 20-year-old software. Project costing was guesswork. We spent more time in spreadsheets than on engineering."

- **Real-time project profitability** visibility
