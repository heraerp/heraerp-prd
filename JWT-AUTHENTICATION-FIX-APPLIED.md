# JWT Authentication Fix - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## üéØ Problem Summary

After creating/restoring products, users were redirected to login page with "session expired" error, even after logging out and back in.

**User Impact:**
- Product creation succeeded (200 OK)
- Immediately redirected to `/salon/auth?error=Your+session+has+expired`
- Prevented any product operations from completing workflow

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Diagnostic Results:

```bash
‚úÖ User entity exists in core_entities
‚úÖ MEMBER_OF relationship exists in core_relationships
‚úÖ Organization exists and is valid
‚ùå JWT token missing organization_id in user metadata
```

### Why Authentication Was Failing:

The `verifyAuth()` function has three-tier organization resolution:

1. **Header**: `X-Organization-Id` header (not being sent)
2. **JWT**: `organization_id` in JWT token payload (MISSING)
3. **Resolved**: Query `core_relationships` for memberships (may fail due to RLS)

**The Problem:**
- JWT token had no `organization_id` in user metadata
- verifyAuth() tried to query memberships as fallback
- RLS policies may have prevented the query from returning results
- Result: Empty `allowedOrgs` array ‚Üí 401 Unauthorized

### Evidence from Logs:

```
[JWT Service] Organization lookup: {
  userId: 'b3fcd455-7df2-42d2-bdd1-c962636cc8a7',
  found: false,
  organizationId: undefined,
  source: 'user_metadata'
}

[verifyAuth] No valid org membership {
  userId: 'b3fcd455-7df2-42d2-bdd1-c962636cc8a7',
  jwtOrg: undefined,           ‚Üê Missing from JWT
  headerOrg: undefined,         ‚Üê Not sent
  allowedOrgs: []              ‚Üê Query returned no results
}
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

Updated JWT user metadata to include organization context:

```javascript
await supabase.auth.admin.updateUserById(userId, {
  user_metadata: {
    organization_id: '378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8'
  }
})
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "email_verified": true,
  "full_name": "Receptionist Two",
  "organization_id": "378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8"  ‚Üê Added
}
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

**IMPORTANT:** User MUST log out and log back in for changes to take effect.

### Step 1: Log Out
1. Click logout button in UI
2. Clear browser session storage (optional but recommended)

### Step 2: Log Back In
1. Go to login page: `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Enter credentials: `hairtalkz02@gmail.com` / password
3. New JWT token will be generated with organization_id included

### Step 3: Verify JWT Token (Optional)
```javascript
// In browser console
const session = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token'))
console.log(session.user.user_metadata.organization_id)
// Should output: '378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8'
```

### Step 4: Test Product Operations
1. **Create Product:**
   - Go to `/salon/products`
   - Click "New Product"
   - Fill in details
   - Click "Save"
   - ‚úÖ Should stay on products page (NOT redirect to login)

2. **Restore Archived Product:**
   - Go to `/salon/products`
   - Toggle "Show Archived"
   - Click restore icon on archived product
   - ‚úÖ Should restore without redirect

3. **Update Product:**
   - Edit existing product
   - Save changes
   - ‚úÖ Should save without redirect

## üìä Before vs After

### Before (Broken):
```
[User Login] ‚Üí [JWT without org_id] ‚Üí [Product Operation]
‚Üí [verifyAuth fails] ‚Üí [401 Unauthorized] ‚Üí [Redirect to login]
```

### After (Fixed):
```
[User Login] ‚Üí [JWT with org_id] ‚Üí [Product Operation]
‚Üí [verifyAuth success] ‚Üí [200 OK] ‚Üí [Operation completes]
```

## üîß Technical Details

### How verifyAuth() Now Works:

```typescript
// Priority order for organization resolution:
1. Header: X-Organization-Id (explicit request)
2. JWT: organization_id in token payload ‚Üê NOW WORKS
3. Resolved: Query memberships table (fallback)

// With JWT metadata fix:
const jwtOrg = payload.organization_id  // '378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8'
const allowedOrgs = ['378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8']

if (jwtOrg && allowedOrgs.includes(jwtOrg)) {
  organizationId = jwtOrg  // ‚úÖ Success
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Long-Term Improvements

This fix addresses the immediate issue, but we should implement these improvements:

### 1. Enhanced Login Flow
Update `/src/app/api/v2/auth/resolve-membership/route.ts` to always set JWT metadata during login:

```typescript
// After self-healing succeeds
await supabase.auth.admin.updateUserById(userEntityId, {
  user_metadata: {
    organization_id: organizationId
  }
})
```

### 2. Signup Flow
Ensure all new users get organization_id in metadata during signup.

### 3. Session Refresh
Add organization_id to session refresh tokens automatically.

### 4. RLS Policy Review
Review `core_relationships` RLS policies to ensure authenticated users can query their own memberships.

- Create products ‚úì
- Update products ‚úì
- Restore archived products ‚úì
- No authentication errors ‚úì
- No unexpected redirects ‚úì
