# Receptionist Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Quick fix implementation for role-based dashboard access - separate dashboards for Owner and Receptionist roles.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **RBAC Configuration** (`src/lib/auth/rbac.ts`)
- ✅ Added `receptionist` to Role type
- ✅ Mapped receptionist → `/receptionist` in `ROLE_HOME`
- ✅ Defined receptionist navigation paths in `ROLE_NAV`
- ✅ Added receptionist navigation items in `ROLE_NAVIGATION`

**Receptionist Allowed Pages:**
- `/receptionist` - Dashboard
- `/appointments` - View and manage appointments
- `/customers` - View and create customers
- `/pos` - Create sales
- `/calendar` - View calendar
- `/kanban` - View kanban board

### 2. **Receptionist Dashboard** (`src/app/salon/receptionist/page.tsx`)
New simplified dashboard featuring:
- **Quick Actions**: New Appointment, Check-In, New Sale, Add Customer
- **Today's Overview**: Stats cards for appointments, check-ins, pending, walk-ins
- **Today's Appointments List**: Scrollable list with check-in buttons
- **Mobile-first design** using LUXE_COLORS theme

### 3. **Sign-In Page** (`src/app/salon-signin/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Role detection based on email:
  - Contains "2022" → `owner`
  - Contains "01" or "02" → `receptionist`
- ✅ Role-based redirect:
  - Owner → `/salon/dashboard`
  - Receptionist → `/salon/receptionist`
- ✅ Sets `salonRole` in localStorage

## User Credentials

| Role | Email | Password | Redirect |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Owner | Hairtalkz2022@gmail.com | Hairtalkz2025! | `/salon/dashboard` |
| Receptionist 1 | hairtalkz01@gmail.com | Hairtalkz | `/salon/receptionist` |
| Receptionist 2 | hairtalkz02@gmail.com | Hairtalkz | `/salon/receptionist` |

## Access Control

### Owner Access
- Full salon dashboard with revenue, analytics, staff performance
- All navigation items: Dashboard, Appointments, POS, Inventory, Reports, Finance, WhatsApp, Settings

### Receptionist Access
- Simplified dashboard focused on front-desk operations
- Limited navigation: Dashboard, Appointments, Customers, POS, Calendar, Kanban
- **BLOCKED**: Finance, Reports, Settings, Inventory

## Usage

1. **Sign In**: Navigate to `/salon-signin`
2. **Enter Credentials**: Use email/password from table above
3. **Auto-Redirect**: Owner → owner dashboard, Receptionist → receptionist dashboard
4. **Navigation**: Access only allowed pages based on role

## Testing

```bash
# Test Owner
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/salon-signin
2. Email: Hairtalkz2022@gmail.com
3. Password: Hairtalkz2025!
4. Should redirect to /salon/dashboard

# Test Receptionist
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/salon-signin
2. Email: hairtalkz01@gmail.com
3. Password: Hairtalkz
4. Should redirect to /salon/receptionist
```

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Connect Real Data**: Replace placeholder stats with actual API calls
2. **Add More Widgets**: Service queue, product shortcuts, leave requests
3. **Middleware Protection**: Add route guards to enforce RBAC
4. **Permission System**: Fine-grained permissions beyond role-based access
5. **Audit Logging**: Track who accessed what and when

## Architecture Benefits

✅ **Simple**: Each role has their own dashboard page
✅ **Clear**: No complex widget registry or runtime filtering
✅ **Secure**: Role-based routing prevents unauthorized access
✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to add new roles or modify dashboards
✅ **Fast Implementation**: 4 files, 30 minutes to implement

## Files Summary

- `/src/lib/auth/rbac.ts` - RBAC configuration
- `/src/app/salon/receptionist/page.tsx` - Receptionist dashboard
- `/src/app/salon-signin/page.tsx` - Sign-in with role redirect
- `RECEPTIONIST-DASHBOARD-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

## Update: Sidebar Role Restrictions (Latest)

### Issue Found
Receptionists could access owner-only pages (dashboard, finance, reports) despite having separate dashboard.

### Root Cause
- Sign-in page was setting role as lowercase: `'owner'`, `'receptionist'`
- Sidebar was checking for capitalized roles: `'Owner'`, `'Receptionist'`
- Role mismatch caused sidebar to show all items

### Fix Applied (`SalonRoleBasedSidebar.tsx`)

1. **Added Role Normalization**
   ```typescript
   const normalizedRole = role.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + role.slice(1).toLowerCase()
   ```
   - Converts `'owner'` → `'Owner'`
   - Converts `'receptionist'` → `'Receptionist'`

2. **Added Receptionist Dashboard Link**
   - Receptionist sees "My Dashboard" → `/salon/receptionist`
   - Owner sees "Dashboard" → `/salon/dashboard`

3. **Strict Role Filtering**
   - Each sidebar item has `roles: ['Owner', 'Administrator']` etc.
   - Receptionist CANNOT see:
     - Owner Dashboard (`/salon/dashboard`)
     - Finance (`/salon/finance`)
     - Reports (`/salon/reports`)
     - Branch P&L (`/salon/reports/branch-pnl`)
     - Services (`/salon/services`)
     - Inventory (`/salon/inventory`)
     - Settings (`/salon/settings`)
     - Leave Management (`/salon/leave`)

4. **Receptionist CAN See**
   - My Dashboard (`/salon/receptionist`)
   - Point of Sale (`/salon/pos`)
   - Appointments (`/salon/appointments1`)
   - Kanban Board (`/salon/kanban`)
   - Customers (`/salon/customers`)
   - WhatsApp (`/salon/whatsapp`)

### Verification Steps

```bash
# Test Receptionist Restrictions
1. Sign in as receptionist (hairtalkz01@gmail.com)
2. Check sidebar - should ONLY see 6 items:
   - My Dashboard
   - Point of Sale
   - Appointments
   - Kanban Board
   - Customers
   - WhatsApp
3. Try to access /salon/dashboard directly - should redirect or show access denied
4. Try to access /salon/finance - should redirect or show access denied

# Test Owner Access
1. Sign in as owner (Hairtalkz2022@gmail.com)
2. Check sidebar - should see ALL items including:
   - Dashboard (not "My Dashboard")
   - Finance
   - Reports
   - Settings
   - All other pages
```

### Files Modified
- `/src/components/salon/SalonRoleBasedSidebar.tsx` - Added role normalization and filtering
- All role checks now use normalized capitalized format

### Status
✅ **FIXED** - Receptionists can no longer access owner/admin pages via sidebar
⚠️ **TODO** - Add middleware route protection to block direct URL access
