## 🚀 **How to Use When You Return**

### **Immediate Commands**
```bash
# Start MCP server
npm start

# Test complete system
npm run test:all

# Check current HERA compliance
"verify-hera-compliance"

# Track build progress
"check-hera-formula"
```

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Check Status**: `"check-hera-formula"` to see build progress
2. **Develop Features**: Use universal MCP tools for development
3. **Real-Time Validation**: `"validate-architecture"` during development
4. **Pre-Deployment**: `"check-quality-gates"` before releases
5. **Final Verification**: `"verify-hera-compliance"` for Chief Architect review

### **Priority Next Steps**
1. **Complete Smart Coding (SC)**: Currently at 26%, needs to reach 75%
2. **Finish Universal UI (UUI)**: Currently at 85%, needs final 15%
3. **Expand Industry Apps (IA)**: Currently at 33%, target 50%+
4. **Address Auth Test Issues**: Fix UUID format issues in auth tests

## 🎯 **Key Principles to Remember**

### **SACRED Rules (Never Violate)**
1. **Organization ID Required**: All operations must include organization_id
2. **No Schema Changes**: Use core_dynamic_data for custom fields
3. **Universal Tables Only**: Only use the 6 sacred tables
4. **Smart Codes Required**: All entities need HERA.INDUSTRY.MODULE.FUNCTION.v1
5. **AI-Native**: Built-in AI fields, not separate infrastructure

### **HERA Build Formula**
```
HERA = UT + UA + UUI + SC + BM + IA
Current: 100% + 100% + 85% + 26% + 157% + 33% = 81% overall
Target: 85% minimum for deployment approval
```

### **Quality Gates**
- **Performance**: 85% minimum
- **Security**: 95% minimum  
- **HERA Compliance**: 90% minimum
- **Smart Code Coverage**: 80% minimum

## 💡 **Quick Context Recovery**

**When you return, just ask:**
- `"What's my current HERA compliance status?"` → Will show 78% with breakdown
- `"What needs to be completed next?"` → Will identify Smart Coding priority
- `"Run a complete system verification"` → Full 26-point compliance check
- `"Show me the build formula progress"` → UT+UA+UUI+SC+BM+IA status

**All verification and tracking is automated through the MCP tools - no manual checking required.**
