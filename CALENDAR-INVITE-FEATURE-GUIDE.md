## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Production Setup**: Real WhatsApp API needed for actual file sending
2. **File Storage**: ICS files need cloud storage (S3, etc.) in production
3. **Calendar Apps**: Tested with iOS, Android, Outlook, Google Calendar
4. **Time Zones**: Always use UTC in ICS, apps convert to local
