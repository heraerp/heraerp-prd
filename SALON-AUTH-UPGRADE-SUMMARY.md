## 📋 Work Completed

### 1. Supabase Migration (✅ Complete)

**Old Instance:** `qqagokigwuujyeyrgdkq.supabase.co`
**New Instance:** `ralywraqvuqgdezttfde.supabase.co`

**Verification:**

### 2. Authentication Flow (✅ Complete)

**Verified Complete Authentication Chain:**

```
Step 1: Supabase Auth
  ↓ JWT token generated
Step 2: hera_auth_introspect_v1 RPC
  ↓ Organization + role resolved
Step 3: HERA RBAC → Salon Role Mapping
  ↓ ORG_OWNER → owner, ORG_EMPLOYEE → receptionist
Step 4: Role-Based Redirect
  ↓ Owner → /salon/dashboard, Receptionist → /salon/receptionist
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Owner (`hairtalkz2022@gmail.com`) - ORG_OWNER → owner
