# HERA MCP Server UAT Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

The HERA MCP (Model Context Protocol) server currently provides basic CRUD operations through natural language. To support comprehensive UAT (User Acceptance Testing), we need to enhance it with business-specific operations, complex workflows, and scenario-based testing capabilities.

### Key Objectives
1. **Expand Coverage**: From 30% to 95% of business scenarios
2. **Accelerate Testing**: 10x faster test creation through natural language
3. **Ensure Quality**: Zero-defect releases with comprehensive testing
4. **Reduce Costs**: $50K+ savings per implementation

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Capabilities
The current MCP server provides:
- ‚úÖ Basic entity creation (customers, products, services)
- ‚úÖ Simple transaction creation
- ‚úÖ Query operations
- ‚úÖ Natural language interpretation
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant isolation

### Limitations
- ‚ùå No POS transaction workflows
- ‚ùå No payment processing
- ‚ùå No inventory management
- ‚ùå No appointment scheduling workflows
- ‚ùå No reporting/analytics
- ‚ùå No batch operations
- ‚ùå No return/exchange handling
- ‚ùå No financial operations
- ‚ùå Limited business validation
- ‚ùå No scenario-based testing

## Implementation Code Examples

### Enhanced Interpretation Engine
```javascript
async function interpretCommand(message, context) {
  const patterns = {
    // POS patterns
    posPatterns: [
      /(?:create|process|ring up) (?:a )?sale/i,
      /checkout|check out/i,
      /charge|bill/i
    ],
    
    // Inventory patterns
    inventoryPatterns: [
      /(?:add|remove|adjust) (\d+) (?:units? )?(?:of |to )?inventory/i,
      /stock (?:level|count|adjustment)/i,
      /transfer (?:products?|items?|inventory)/i
    ],
    
    // Appointment patterns
    appointmentPatterns: [
      /(?:book|schedule|create) (?:an? )?appointment/i,
      /(?:available|free) (?:slots?|times?)/i,
      /reschedule|cancel appointment/i
    ],
    
    // Payment patterns
    paymentPatterns: [
      /(?:pay|payment) (?:with|by|using)/i,
      /split payment/i,
      /process (?:payment|refund)/i
    ]
  };
  
  // Enhanced pattern matching with context awareness
  const enhancedInterpretation = await analyzeWithContext(message, patterns, context);
  
  return enhancedInterpretation;
}
```

### Business Logic Validation
```javascript
async function validateBusinessRules(operation, params) {
  const rules = {
    'create-pos-sale': [
      checkInventoryAvailability,
      validatePricing,
      checkCustomerCredit,
      applyDiscountRules
    ],
    'schedule-appointment': [
      checkStaffAvailability,
      validateServiceDuration,
      checkBookingConflicts,
      enforceBookingPolicies
    ],
    'process-return': [
      validateReturnPolicy,
      checkOriginalTransaction,
      calculateRestockingFee,
      verifyProductCondition
    ]
  };
  
  const applicableRules = rules[operation] || [];
  
  for (const rule of applicableRules) {
    const result = await rule(params);
    if (!result.valid) {
      throw new Error(`Business rule violation: ${result.message}`);
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### Workflow Orchestration
```javascript
async function executeWorkflow(workflow, context) {
  const workflows = {
    'complete-sale': [
      'validate-items',
      'check-inventory',
      'calculate-totals',
      'apply-tax',
      'process-payment',
      'update-inventory',
      'generate-receipt',
      'update-analytics'
    ],
    'appointment-booking': [
      'check-availability',
      'validate-service',
      'reserve-slot',
      'send-confirmation',
      'create-reminder',
      'update-calendar'
    ]
  };
  
  const steps = workflows[workflow];
  const results = [];
  
  for (const step of steps) {
    try {
      const result = await executeStep(step, context);
      results.push({ step, status: 'success', result });
    } catch (error) {
      results.push({ step, status: 'failed', error: error.message });
      break;
    }
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

## Testing Framework

### UAT Test Runner
```javascript
class UATTestRunner {
  constructor(mcpServer) {
    this.mcpServer = mcpServer;
    this.results = [];
  }
  
  async runScenario(scenario) {
    console.log(`üß™ Running UAT Scenario: ${scenario.name}`);
    
    for (const step of scenario.steps) {
      try {
        const result = await this.executeStep(step);
        this.logSuccess(step, result);
      } catch (error) {
        this.logFailure(step, error);
        if (scenario.stopOnError) break;
      }
    }
    
    return this.generateReport();
  }
  
  async executeStep(step) {
    const { command, expectedResult, validation } = step;
    
    const result = await this.mcpServer.chat({
      message: command,
      organizationId: this.organizationId
    });
    
    if (validation) {
      await validation(result, expectedResult);
    }
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Batch Operations
```javascript
{
  name: "batch-operation",
  description: "Execute multiple operations in a single request",
  parameters: {
    operations: [{
      type: "create-entity",
      params: { /* entity params */ }
    }, {
      type: "update-inventory",
      params: { /* inventory params */ }
    }],
    transaction_mode: "all-or-nothing",
    parallel: false
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy
```javascript
const cache = {
  products: new Map(),
  services: new Map(),
  customers: new Map(),
  
  async get(type, id) {
    const cached = this[type].get(id);
    if (cached && cached.expiry > Date.now()) {
      return cached.data;
    }
    return null;
  },
  
  set(type, id, data, ttl = 300000) {
    this[type].set(id, {
      data,
      expiry: Date.now() + ttl
    });
  }
};
```

## Success Metrics
