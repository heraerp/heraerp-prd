# Furniture Module CRUD Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the furniture products catalog page with dark theme styling and proper data management.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. **EditProductModal Component** (`/src/components/furniture/EditProductModal.tsx`)
- Dark-themed modal matching the furniture dashboard design
- Comprehensive form with all product fields:
  - Basic info: Name, SKU
  - Categories and materials with dropdowns
  - Dimensions (length, width, height)
  - Pricing (selling price, cost price)
  - Inventory (stock quantity, reorder point)
  - Description field
- Updates both entity fields and dynamic data
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Success callback for refreshing parent data

### 2. **Products Catalog Page Updates** (`/src/app/furniture/products/catalog/page.tsx`)
- Added Edit functionality with modal integration
- Added Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- Added success notifications for all CRUD operations
- Updated action buttons to include Edit and Delete
- Integrated EditProductModal component
- Loading states for delete operations
- Proper state management for editing and deleting

### 3. **API Endpoints**
Using existing furniture products API endpoint (`/api/furniture/products`) that:
- Bypasses RLS using service role keys
- Returns products with dynamic field data
- Supports organization-based filtering

### 4. **Seed Data Scripts**
Created comprehensive seed data scripts:
- `seed-furniture-products.js`: Creates 10 realistic furniture products with:
  - Proper smart codes following the constraint pattern
  - Complete dynamic field data (dimensions, pricing, inventory)
  - Various categories: office, seating, tables, storage
  - Realistic pricing and stock levels

### 5. **Test Scripts**
Created test scripts to verify functionality:
- `test-product-crud.js`: Tests all CRUD operations
- `test-product-api-update.js`: Tests update functionality with dynamic fields

## Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Code Pattern
All products use the pattern: `HERA.FURNITURE.PRODUCT.{CATEGORY}.{TYPE}.v1`
- Examples: 
  - `HERA.FURNITURE.PRODUCT.OFFICE.CHAIR.v1`
  - `HERA.FURNITURE.PRODUCT.STORAGE.CABINET.v1`

### Dynamic Fields Structure
Each product stores attributes in `core_dynamic_data`:
- `category` (text): Product category
- `material` (text): Material type
- `length_cm`, `width_cm`, `height_cm` (number): Dimensions
- `price`, `cost` (number): Pricing
- `stock_quantity`, `reorder_point` (number): Inventory
- `description` (text): Product description

### Dark Theme Styling
- Consistent with furniture module design
- Gray-900 backgrounds for modals
- Gray-800/700 for inputs and borders
- Proper hover states and focus management
- Z-index fixes for dropdowns in modals

## Usage Instructions

1. **View Products**: Navigate to `/furniture/products/catalog`
2. **Create Product**: Click "New Product" button
3. **Edit Product**: Click pencil icon in actions column
4. **Delete Product**: Click trash icon (with confirmation)
5. **Search**: Use search bar to filter products

## Future Enhancements

- Export to Excel/CSV
- Import from file
- Advanced filtering options
- Product image management
- Inventory tracking integration
- BOM (Bill of Materials) management
