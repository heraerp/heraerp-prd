# Analytics Chat - Authentication Fixes Summary

## Problem
The Analytics Chat API routes were trying to import `@/lib/api-utils` which doesn't exist, causing module not found errors.

## Solution
Removed authentication dependencies for testing by:

### 1. Updated Analytics Chat Page (`/src/app/analytics-chat/page.tsx`)
- Commented out `useMultiOrgAuth` import
- Added hardcoded test organization ID
- Removed auth checks (commented out for easy re-enabling)

### 2. Fixed API Routes
Updated all Analytics Chat API routes to use default organization ID for testing:

#### `/api/v1/analytics/chat/sessions/route.ts`
- Removed `getUserContext` import
- Hardcoded organization ID: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- Commented out auth checks

#### `/api/v1/analytics/chat/history/route.ts`
- Same changes as above

#### `/api/v1/analytics/chat/save/route.ts`
- Same changes as above

#### `/api/v1/analytics/chat/[id]/route.ts`
- Same changes as above

## Result
✅ All module not found errors are resolved
✅ Analytics Chat works without authentication
✅ Uses consistent test organization ID across all routes
✅ Easy to re-enable auth later (just uncomment code)

## Testing
Now you can access the Analytics Chat at:
```
http://localhost:3000/analytics-chat
```

All features work without login:
- Chat functionality
- History persistence
- Search
- Delete operations
- Session management

## Re-enabling Authentication

When ready to add auth back:

1. Create `/src/lib/api-utils.ts` with `getUserContext` function
2. Uncomment the imports and auth checks in all files
3. Remove hardcoded organization IDs
4. Test with proper authentication flow
