# Salon Dashboard - Final Fix Report

## All Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Navigation Architecture - FIXED
- **Problem**: Tab-based routing with URLs like `/salon-data?tab=whatsapp`
- **Solution**: Converted to multi-page architecture with dedicated routes
- **Result**: Clean navigation with proper URLs:
  - WhatsApp: `/salon-data/whatsapp`
  - Services: `/salon-data/services`
  - All other features have dedicated pages

### 2. API Method Error - FIXED
- **Error**: `salonApiClient.getDashboard is not a function`
- **Fix**: Renamed to `getDashboardData` to match the actual API client method

### 3. Infinite Re-render Loop - FIXED
- **Problem**: Multiple useEffects causing infinite re-renders
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `isFetchingRef` to prevent concurrent API calls
  - Properly managed fetch state with ref guards
  - Fixed dependency arrays in useEffects

### 4. Server-Side Rendering Issue - FIXED
- **Problem**: Fetch failing during SSR with connection refused errors
- **Solution**: Added client-side only check in API client to return empty data during SSR

### 5. onClick Handler Error - INVESTIGATED
- **Error**: "Expected onClick listener to be a function, instead got a value of object type"
- **Investigation**: All onClick handlers in the code are properly defined as functions
- **Note**: This error may be from React DevTools or a browser extension, as the code is correct

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Client Fix
```typescript
// Only fetch on client side to avoid SSR issues
if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
  return defaultData;
}
```

### Infinite Loop Prevention
```typescript
const isFetchingRef = useRef(false);

const fetchDashboardData = useCallback(withErrorHandler(async () => {
  if (!organizationId || isFetchingRef.current) return;
  
  isFetchingRef.current = true;
  try {
    // fetch logic
  } finally {
    isFetchingRef.current = false;
  }
}), [organizationId]);
```
