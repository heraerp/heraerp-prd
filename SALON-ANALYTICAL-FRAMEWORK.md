# HERA Salon Manager - Analytical AI Framework

## 🤖 The 5-Stage Analytical Process

The Salon Manager now uses an intelligent analytical framework that mimics human problem-solving:

### 1. 🤔 **ANALYZE** - Understand the Request
- Parses natural language input
- Identifies key information (names, dates, services)
- Detects user intent
- Assesses completeness of information

### 2. 🔍 **INVESTIGATE** - Explore the Data
- Searches relevant databases
- Gathers context from multiple sources
- Identifies patterns and relationships
- Checks for conflicts or issues

### 3. ❓ **CLARIFY** - Ask When Needed
- Detects missing information
- Forms specific questions
- Provides examples for guidance
- Offers multiple choice options when appropriate

### 4. 🎯 **TARGET** - Provide Focused Solutions
- Executes the requested action
- Provides specific, actionable results
- Includes relevant next steps
- Offers related actions

### 5. 🔄 **ITERATE** - Refine and Improve
- Learns from interactions
- Suggests follow-up actions
- Adapts to user preferences
- Continuously improves responses

## 📋 Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Vague Appointment Request
```
User: "book appointment"
```

**AI Response (CLARIFY stage):**
```
🤔 I'd like to help you better. Could you clarify:
1. What service would you like to book?
2. When would you like the appointment? (e.g., 'tomorrow at 2pm')
3. Do you have a preferred stylist?

💡 Examples:
• "Book Emma for highlights tomorrow at 2pm"
• "Schedule a haircut with any available stylist today"
```

### Example 2: Complete Request
```
User: "Book Sarah Johnson for highlights tomorrow at 2pm with Emma"
```

**AI Response (TARGET stage):**
```
✅ Appointment booked for Sarah Johnson with Emma on [date] at 2:00 PM

🔍 Next steps:
• Send confirmation to client
• Check stylist availability
• Review service preparation

```

### Example 3: Investigation Needed
```
User: "what time is San's appointment"
```

**AI Process:**
1. **ANALYZE**: Extract "San" as client name
2. **INVESTIGATE**: Search for appointments for clients matching "San"
3. **TARGET**: Display found appointments with times

### Example 4: Analytics Request
```
User: "show insights"
```

**AI Response (ITERATE stage):**
```
