## üìù Alternative Prompts for Different Industries:

### Healthcare EMR:
```
Replace "Restaurant / Food Service" with "Healthcare / Medical Records"
Replace "Menu Management" with "Patient Management" 
Replace "Order Taking" with "Treatment Planning"
Apply `HERA.HLTH.INV.SPECIALIZATION.v1` instead of restaurant DNA
```

### Manufacturing ERP:
```
Replace "Restaurant / Food Service" with "Manufacturing / Production"
Replace "Menu Management" with "Product Management"
Replace "Order Taking" with "Production Planning"  
Apply `HERA.MFG.INV.SPECIALIZATION.v1` instead of restaurant DNA
```

Each industry uses the same UI DNA patterns but different business module DNA for perfect specialization while maintaining universal foundation.
