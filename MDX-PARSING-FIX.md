# MDX Parsing Error Fix

## Problem
The blog system was encountering MDX parsing errors due to incorrect frontmatter formatting in generated blog posts.

## Root Cause
The blog post generators (`generate_test_post.ts` and `generate_daily_post.ts`) were using `JSON.stringify()` to format complex objects in the frontmatter, which created JSON syntax with curly braces `{}` that MDX tried to parse as JSX expressions.

Example of problematic frontmatter:
```yaml
faq: [{"q":"How much?","a":"$299/month"}]  # ❌ Curly braces cause MDX parsing errors
local_stats: {"business_count":"15,000"}    # ❌ JSON syntax in YAML
```

## Solution
Fixed the generators to use proper YAML formatting:

1. Created helper functions to convert arrays and objects to YAML format
2. Arrays use YAML list syntax with `-` and proper indentation
3. Objects use YAML key-value syntax with proper nesting
4. No curly braces or JSON syntax that could confuse MDX

Example of correct frontmatter:
```yaml
faq:
  - q: "How much?"
    a: "$299/month"
local_stats:
  business_count: "15,000"
  growth_rate: "12%"
```

## Files Fixed
1. `/scripts/generate_test_post.ts` - Test post generator
2. `/scripts/generate_daily_post.ts` - Daily automated post generator  
3. `/blog-automation/scripts/generate_daily_post.ts` - Duplicate generator

## Testing
- Deleted the problematic MDX file
- Regenerated with the fixed generator
- Blog system now works without MDX parsing errors

## Key Takeaway
When generating MDX files programmatically, always use proper YAML formatting in the frontmatter. Avoid JSON syntax, especially curly braces, as MDX will try to parse them as JSX expressions.
