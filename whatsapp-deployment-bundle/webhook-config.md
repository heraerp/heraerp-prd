  "entry": [{
    "changes": [{
      "value": {
        "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
        "messages": [{
          "from": "919876543210",
          "id": "wamid.xxx",
          "timestamp": "1234567890",
          "text": {
            "body": "Hi, I want to book an appointment"
          },

  }]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Verifying
- Check token matches exactly (no spaces)
- Ensure URL is HTTPS
- Verify Railway app is deployed and running
- Check Railway logs during verification

### Not Receiving Messages
- Confirm webhook is subscribed to "messages" field
- Check if sender has messaged your business first
- Verify in Meta webhook logs (Webhooks â†’ View Details)
- Ensure Railway app has no errors

### Common Errors

#### Token Mismatch
```
Error: Webhook verification failed
Fix: Ensure WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_TOKEN in Railway matches Meta config
```

#### SSL/HTTPS Issues
```
Error: Webhook callback verification failed
Fix: Confirm using https:// not http://
```

#### Timeout
```
Error: Webhook didn't respond in time
Fix: Check Railway app performance, ensure < 20s response
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your verification token**
2. **Use environment variables** (not hardcoded)
3. **Validate webhook signatures** (optional but recommended)
4. **Log webhook attempts** for security monitoring
5. **Rate limit** incoming requests

## Webhook Monitoring

### In Meta Business Manager
- Go to Webhooks â†’ View Details
- Check "Recent Entries" for delivery status
- Monitor error rates

### In Railway
- Set up alerts for webhook errors
- Monitor response times
- Track message volume

## Next Steps

After webhook is configured:
1. Test with real messages
2. Implement message handling logic
3. Set up automated responses
4. Configure reminder system
5. Enable customer service flows

Your webhook is the gateway to WhatsApp automation! ðŸŽ‰
