# WhatsApp Page Visibility Fixes

## Overview
Fixed text and icon visibility issues in the WhatsApp Business page (`/salon/whatsapp`) to ensure proper display in both light and dark modes.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Badge Import
- **File**: `/src/app/salon/whatsapp/page.tsx`
- **Fix**: Added missing `Badge` import from `@/components/ui/badge`

### 2. Dark Mode Text Visibility
Fixed multiple text elements that were not visible in dark mode:

#### Main Page Header
- **Title**: Added `dark:text-white` to the h1 heading
- **Description**: Added `dark:text-gray-300` to the paragraph
- **Background**: Added dark mode gradient `dark:from-gray-900 dark:via-purple-900/20 dark:to-gray-900`

#### WhatsApp Manager Component
- **Section Title**: Added `text-gray-900 dark:text-white` to "WhatsApp Business" heading
- **Template Names**: Added `text-gray-900 dark:text-white` to template card titles
- **Sample Text**: Changed to `text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200` for better readability
- **Automation Names**: Added `text-gray-900 dark:text-white` to automation titles
- **Quick Action Labels**: Added `text-gray-900 dark:text-white` to button labels
- **Analytics Text**: Added `dark:text-gray-400` to coming soon text
- **Usage Stats**: Added `dark:text-gray-400` to template usage text
- **Response Count**: Added `dark:text-green-400` to automation response counts

### 3. Date Display Fix
- **Issue**: `toRelativeTimeString()` method doesn't exist on Date objects
- **Fix**: Changed to `new Date(template.lastUsed).toLocaleDateString()` for proper date display

## Files Modified
1. `/src/app/salon/whatsapp/page.tsx`
2. `/src/components/salon/SalonWhatsAppManager.tsx`

## Visual Improvements
- All text is now clearly visible in both light and dark modes
- Icons maintain proper contrast with their backgrounds
- Card backgrounds provide proper contrast for content
- Status badges and metrics are clearly readable
- Quick action buttons have proper text visibility

## Testing Recommendations
1. Toggle between light and dark modes to verify all text is visible
2. Check that icons in quick actions are properly displayed
3. Verify template cards show all information clearly
4. Ensure automation status and response counts are readable
5. Confirm date displays properly in template usage stats
