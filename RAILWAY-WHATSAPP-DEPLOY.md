```

5. **Click "Update Variables"**

### Step 4: Deploy

Railway will automatically deploy when you add variables. You can also:

- Takes about 3-5 minutes

### Step 5: Get Your Domain

1. **Go to Settings â†’ Domains**
2. **Click "Generate Domain"**
3. **You'll get something like**: `hera-production.up.railway.app`

   ```
4. **Verify Token**: `hera-whatsapp-webhook-2024-secure-token`
5. **Click "Verify and Save"**

## ðŸ§ª Test Your Deployment

### 1. Test Webhook Verification
```bash
curl "https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/api/v1/whatsapp/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=hera-whatsapp-webhook-2024-secure-token&hub.challenge=test123"
```

Should return: `test123`

### 2. Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"healthy"}`

### 3. Send Test WhatsApp Message
