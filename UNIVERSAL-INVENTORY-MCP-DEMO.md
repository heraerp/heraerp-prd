# üöÄ Live Demo: Building Universal Inventory Module with MCP

## üéØ **Real-Time Universal Inventory Module Creation**

Let's build a complete Universal Inventory Module using natural language MCP commands!

---

## üì¶ **Step 1: Create Universal Inventory Foundation**

### **MCP Command 1: Universal Inventory Item Setup**
```bash
# What you'd type in Claude Desktop:
"Create a universal inventory item for fresh tomatoes with FIFO valuation method"

# What MCP does automatically:
‚úÖ Creates core_entities entry:
{
  "entity_type": "inventory_item",
  "entity_name": "Fresh Tomatoes", 
  "smart_code": "HERA.INV.ITEM.PRODUCE.v1",
  "organization_id": "mario_restaurant_001",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "produce",
    "valuation_method": "FIFO",
    "unit_of_measure": "lbs"
  }
}

‚úÖ Creates core_dynamic_data entries:
- field_name: "unit_cost", field_value_number: 2.50
- field_name: "reorder_level", field_value_number: 50
- field_name: "supplier", field_value_text: "Fresh Foods Inc"
- field_name: "expiry_days", field_value_number: 7

‚úÖ Validates SACRED rules:
- Organization ID present ‚úÖ
- Uses universal tables only ‚úÖ  
- Generates proper smart code ‚úÖ
- Maintains universal patterns ‚úÖ

Result: Universal inventory item ready for ANY business type!
```

### **MCP Command 2: Universal Receiving Transaction**
```bash
# What you'd type:
"Create a receiving transaction for 100 lbs of tomatoes at $2.50 per lb from supplier Fresh Foods Inc"

# What MCP creates:
‚úÖ Universal transaction header:
{
  "transaction_type": "inventory_receipt",
  "smart_code": "HERA.INV.RCV.TXN.IN.v1",
  "transaction_date": "2025-01-14",
  "total_amount": 250.00,
  "organization_id": "mario_restaurant_001",
  "reference_entity_id": "fresh_foods_supplier_001"
}

‚úÖ Universal transaction line:
{
  "line_entity_id": "tomatoes_fresh_001",
  "quantity": 100,
  "unit_price": 2.50,
  "line_amount": 250.00,
  "smart_code": "HERA.INV.RCV.LINE.ITEM.v1",
  "metadata": {
    "lot_number": "TOM-2025-001",
    "expiry_date": "2025-01-21",
    "fifo_cost_layer": 1
  }
}

‚úÖ Automatic GL integration:
- DR: 1330000 (Inventory Asset) $250.00
- CR: 2100000 (Accounts Payable) $250.00

Result: Complete receiving process with FIFO cost layering!
```

---

## üîÑ **Step 2: Universal Issue/Usage Transactions**

### **MCP Command 3: Universal Inventory Issue**
```bash
# What you'd type:
"Issue 20 lbs of tomatoes for kitchen usage - apply FIFO costing"

# What MCP creates:
‚úÖ Universal issue transaction:
{
  "transaction_type": "inventory_issue",
  "smart_code": "HERA.INV.ISS.TXN.OUT.v1",
  "quantity_issued": 20,
  "fifo_cost_calculation": {
    "oldest_layer_cost": 2.50,
    "cost_of_goods_issued": 50.00,
    "remaining_quantity": 80
  }
}

‚úÖ Automatic GL posting:
- DR: 5110000 (Food Cost) $50.00
- CR: 1330000 (Inventory Asset) $50.00

‚úÖ FIFO cost layer update:
- Layer 1: 80 lbs remaining at $2.50/lb
- Next receipt creates Layer 2

Result: Perfect FIFO costing that works for any business!
```

---

## üìä **Step 3: Universal Valuation Methods**

### **MCP Command 4: Setup Universal Valuation Rules**
```bash
# What you'd type:
"Set up automatic revaluation rules for produce - markdown 25% when 50% of shelf life remains"

# What MCP creates:
‚úÖ Valuation rule entity:
{
  "entity_type": "valuation_rule",
  "smart_code": "HERA.INV.VAL.RULE.EXPIRY.v1",
  "rule_logic": {
    "trigger": "shelf_life_50_percent",
    "action": "markdown_value",
    "percentage": 25,
    "category_filter": "produce"
  }
}

‚úÖ Automatic revaluation process:
- Monitors expiry dates daily
- Triggers markdown when shelf life hits 50%
- Creates revaluation transactions automatically
- Updates inventory value and GL accounts

Result: Smart inventory management that prevents losses!
```

### **MCP Command 5: Universal Valuation Reports**
```bash
# What you'd type:
"Generate an inventory valuation report showing current value by FIFO method"

# What MCP creates:
‚úÖ Valuation report:
{
  "report_type": "inventory_valuation",
  "smart_code": "HERA.INV.RPT.VALUATION.v1",
  "valuation_method": "FIFO",
  "report_data": {
    "tomatoes_fresh": {
      "quantity_on_hand": 80,
      "fifo_cost": 2.50,
      "total_value": 200.00,
      "aging": {
        "0-3_days": 80,
        "4-7_days": 0,
        "expired": 0
      }
    }
  }
}

Result: Complete inventory visibility with aging analysis!
```

## üè≠ **Step 4: Industry Specialization (20% Enhancement)**

### **MCP Command 6: Restaurant-Specific Enhancement**
```bash
# What you'd type:
"Enhance the inventory system for restaurant operations with prep tracking and waste monitoring"

# What MCP adds (builds on universal foundation):
‚úÖ Restaurant prep tracking:
{
  "smart_code": "HERA.REST.INV.PREP.TRACK.v1",
  "prep_transactions": {
    "dice_tomatoes": {
      "input_quantity": 10,
      "output_quantity": 9.5,
      "waste_percentage": 5,
      "prep_labor_cost": 5.00
    }
  }
}

‚úÖ Food waste monitoring:
{
  "smart_code": "HERA.REST.INV.WASTE.MON.v1",
  "waste_tracking": {
    "spoilage": 0.5,
    "prep_waste": 0.5,
    "total_waste_cost": 2.50,
    "waste_percentage": 5.0
  }
}

Result: Restaurant-specific features using 80% universal + 20% specialized!
```

## üîç **Step 5: Real-Time Compliance Verification**

### **MCP Command 7: Architecture Validation**
```bash
# What you'd type:
"Validate that the inventory module follows HERA universal architecture"

# What MCP reports:
‚úÖ SACRED Compliance Check:
- Organization ID filtering: 100% ‚úÖ
- Universal tables only: 100% ‚úÖ 
- Smart code patterns: 100% ‚úÖ
- No schema alterations: 100% ‚úÖ
