# Branch Filter Bug Fix - Daily Sales Reports

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Issue**: Branch filter not working in `/reports/sales/daily` page
**Status**: ✅ **FIX READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

---

## 🐛 Problem Summary

The branch selector in the daily sales report was not filtering transactions:

**Expected**: Selecting "Branch A" shows only transactions from Branch A
**Actual**: All branches show the same transactions (no filtering)

### User Impact
- ❌ Cannot view sales by specific branch
- ❌ Branch selector appears to do nothing
- ❌ Multi-location salons cannot separate branch performance
- ❌ All branches show combined totals

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `hera_txn_query_v1` function was **missing** the `target_entity_id` filter entirely:

### What Was Missing

**1. Filter Variable Declaration** (Line ~27):
```sql
-- ❌ MISSING
v_target_entity_id uuid := NULLIF(p_filters->>'target_entity_id','')::uuid;
```

**2. WHERE Clause Filter** (Lines ~51 and ~98):
```sql
-- ❌ MISSING
AND (v_target_entity_id IS NULL OR t.target_entity_id = v_target_entity_id)
```

### The Data Flow

```
User selects "Branch A" in UI
    ↓
React component passes branchId to hook
    ↓
useDailySalesReport includes target_entity_id in filters
    ↓
useUniversalTransactionV1 sends target_entity_id in payload
    ↓
hera_txn_crud_v1 orchestrator passes payload to query function
    ↓
❌ BUG: hera_txn_query_v1 doesn't extract target_entity_id
    ↓
❌ BUG: WHERE clause doesn't filter by target_entity_id
    ↓
All transactions returned (not filtered by branch)
```

## ✅ The Fix

### Changes Required

**File**: Database function `hera_txn_query_v1`
**Changes**: Add 2 variable declarations + 4 WHERE clause conditions

### 1. Add Filter Variables (After line 27)

```sql
DECLARE
  v_include_deleted  boolean := ...;
  v_txn_type         text    := ...;
  v_status           text    := ...;
  v_smart_code       text    := ...;
  v_source_entity_id uuid    := NULLIF(p_filters->>'source_entity_id','')::uuid;  -- ✅ ADD
  v_target_entity_id uuid    := NULLIF(p_filters->>'target_entity_id','')::uuid;  -- ✅ ADD
  v_date_from        timestamptz := ...;
  v_date_to          timestamptz := ...;
```

### 2. Add WHERE Filters (Count query ~line 51)

```sql
WHERE t.organization_id = p_org_id
  AND (v_include_deleted OR t.transaction_status <> 'voided')
  AND (v_txn_type         IS NULL OR t.transaction_type  = v_txn_type)
  AND (v_status           IS NULL OR t.transaction_status = v_status)
  AND (v_smart_code       IS NULL OR t.smart_code = v_smart_code)
  AND (v_source_entity_id IS NULL OR t.source_entity_id = v_source_entity_id)  -- ✅ ADD
  AND (v_target_entity_id IS NULL OR t.target_entity_id = v_target_entity_id)  -- ✅ ADD
  AND (v_date_from        IS NULL OR t.transaction_date >= v_date_from)
  AND (v_date_to          IS NULL OR t.transaction_date <  v_date_to)
```

### 3. Add WHERE Filters (Results query ~line 98)

```sql
-- Same filters added to the results query (duplicate the WHERE conditions)
```

### Why This Works

1. Client already sends `target_entity_id` correctly ✅
2. Orchestrator already passes full payload ✅ (fixed in previous step)
3. Query function now extracts `target_entity_id` ✅
4. WHERE clause now filters by `target_entity_id` ✅

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Apply the SQL Fix

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire SQL from `/FIX-BRANCH-FILTER.sql`
3. Run the CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION statement
4. Verify deployment:

```sql
SELECT
  proname,
  prosrc LIKE '%v_target_entity_id%' AS has_target_filter
FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname = 'hera_txn_query_v1';

-- Expected: has_target_filter = true
```

### Step 2: Test in Application

1. Navigate to `/salon/reports/sales/daily`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Select "All Branches" - should see all transactions
4. Select a specific branch - should see fewer transactions
5. Verify console logs show correct `target_entity_id`

### Step 3: Verify Filtering

Test these scenarios:

- [ ] "All Branches" + Today = All transactions from today
- [ ] "Branch A" + Today = Only Branch A transactions from today
- [ ] "Branch B" + Today = Only Branch B transactions from today
- [ ] Switch between branches = Results update immediately
- [ ] Summary cards update when changing branches
- [ ] Hourly breakdown updates when changing branches

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
```
Console logs:
  target_entity_id: "abc-123-branch-a"  ✅ Sent correctly

Query results:
  ❌ Returns 10 transactions (all branches)
  ❌ No filtering applied
  ❌ Branch A and Branch B show same data
```

### After Fix
```
Console logs:
  target_entity_id: "abc-123-branch-a"  ✅ Sent correctly

Query results:
  ✅ Returns 3 transactions (only Branch A)
  ✅ Filtering applied correctly
  ✅ Branch A and Branch B show different data
```

## 🧪 Verification Test

After deployment, you can verify the fix works:

```bash
cd mcp-server
node -e "
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import 'dotenv/config'

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
)

const TEST_ORG_ID = process.env.DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID
const TEST_USER_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
const TEST_BRANCH_ID = 'your-branch-uuid-here'

// Test without branch filter
const { data: allData } = await supabase.rpc('hera_txn_crud_v1', {
  p_action: 'QUERY',
  p_actor_user_id: TEST_USER_ID,
  p_organization_id: TEST_ORG_ID,
  p_payload: {
    transaction_type: 'GL_JOURNAL',
    limit: 100
  }
})

console.log('All branches:', allData?.data?.data?.items?.length || 0, 'transactions')

// Test with branch filter
const { data: branchData } = await supabase.rpc('hera_txn_crud_v1', {
  p_action: 'QUERY',
  p_actor_user_id: TEST_USER_ID,
  p_organization_id: TEST_ORG_ID,
  p_payload: {
    transaction_type: 'GL_JOURNAL',
    target_entity_id: TEST_BRANCH_ID,
    limit: 100
  }
})

console.log('Specific branch:', branchData?.data?.data?.items?.length || 0, 'transactions')

if (branchData?.data?.data?.items?.length < allData?.data?.data?.items?.length) {
  console.log('✅ Branch filter is working!')
} else {
  console.log('⚠️ Results are the same - may need to check branch UUID')
}
"
```

## 🎁 Bonus Feature

The fix also adds **`source_entity_id` filtering**, which enables future features:

- Filter sales by specific customer
- Filter purchases by specific vendor
- Filter transfers by source location
- More flexible report filtering

This is forward-compatible and doesn't break existing functionality.

## 📝 Related Files

**Fix SQL**:
- `/FIX-BRANCH-FILTER.sql` - Complete fix with deployment instructions

**Affected Code**:
- `/src/hooks/useSalonSalesReports.ts` - Already sends branch filter correctly
- `/src/app/salon/reports/sales/daily/page.tsx` - Branch selector component
- `/src/components/salon/reports/BranchSelector.tsx` - Branch dropdown

**Database Functions**:
- `hera_txn_query_v1` - Query function (needs 2 lines added in DECLARE, 4 lines in WHERE clauses)
- `hera_txn_crud_v1` - Orchestrator (no changes needed, already fixed)

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **No client code changes required** - Pure database fix
2. **Backward compatible** - Won't break existing functionality
3. **Small change** - Only adding filter logic, not modifying existing logic
4. **Immediate effect** - No cache clearing needed
5. **Works with date filter** - Both filters can be combined

---

## ⚡ Performance Impact

**Positive Impact**: Adding branch filtering **improves** performance:
- Fewer rows scanned in WHERE clause
- Index on `target_entity_id` can be used
- Smaller result sets = faster queries
- Less data transferred to client

---

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Review FIX-BRANCH-FILTER.sql
- [ ] Backup current function (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Run CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify deployment with verification query
- [ ] Test in UI - "All Branches" vs specific branch
- [ ] Check console logs for target_entity_id in payload
- [ ] Verify transaction count changes when selecting branches
- [ ] Test date + branch filtering combination
- [ ] Verify monthly report still works (uses same function)

---

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

After deployment:
- ✅ Branch filtering works correctly
- ✅ Each branch shows its own transactions
- ✅ "All Branches" shows combined data
- ✅ Date + branch filters work together
- ✅ Performance improved (smaller result sets)

---

**Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy
**Risk Level**: LOW (adding filter logic, backward compatible)
**Testing**: Can be verified in UI immediately
**Rollback**: Easy (just revert the function)

Deploy with confidence! 🚀
