# Branch Filter Fix

## Problem
The branch filter in the appointments list page was getting "stuck" on a previously selected branch due to localStorage persistence.

## Solution
We've implemented the following fixes:

1. **Removed persistence from appointments page** - The appointments list now always starts with "All Locations" selected
2. **Auto-clear on page load** - Any stuck filters are automatically cleared when the page loads
3. **Updated useBranchFilter hook** - Better handling of undefined/all states

## How to Clear Stuck Filters

If you're still experiencing issues with stuck filters:

### Method 1: Automatic (Recommended)
The appointments page now automatically clears stuck filters on load. Simply refresh the page.

### Method 2: Browser Console
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Paste and run this command:
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
```
4. Refresh the page

### Method 3: Use Clear Filters Script
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Navigate to: `/clear-filters.js`
4. Or paste this in the console:
```javascript
fetch('/clear-filters.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval)
```

## Technical Details

### What Changed
- `useBranchFilter` hook no longer normalizes undefined to 'all'
- Appointments page doesn't persist branch selection
- Auto-clear logic runs on page mount
- Better validation of persisted values

### localStorage Keys Affected
- `branch-filter-salon-appointments-list`
- `selected-branch`
- `salon-appointments-list-branch`

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Only use persistence where absolutely necessary
2. Always provide clear "reset" functionality
3. Validate persisted values before using them
4. Consider session storage instead of localStorage for temporary filters
