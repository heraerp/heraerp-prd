## 🔧 **MCP Commands for Universal Inventory Module**

### **Step 1: Create Universal Inventory Entities**
```bash
# In Claude Desktop (with MCP running):

"Create a universal inventory item entity for tomatoes with valuation method FIFO"
→ Creates: core_entities entry with smart_code HERA.INV.ITEM.PRODUCE.v1

"Add dynamic fields for expiry date, supplier, and unit cost to the tomato inventory"
→ Creates: core_dynamic_data entries for custom inventory properties

"Create a universal receiving transaction for 100 lbs of tomatoes at $2.50/lb"
→ Creates: universal_transactions + universal_transaction_lines with smart_code HERA.INV.RCV.TXN.IN.v1

"Set up FIFO valuation method for all inventory items in organization"
→ Creates: valuation method configuration with smart_code HERA.INV.VAL.METHOD.FIFO.v1
```

### **Step 2: Create Universal Valuation Rules**
```bash
"Create a valuation revaluation transaction to markdown expired tomatoes by 25%"
→ Creates: Revaluation transaction with smart_code HERA.INV.VAL.TXN.REVALUE.v1

"Generate an inventory valuation report showing current costs by FIFO method" 
→ Creates: Report configuration with smart_code HERA.INV.RPT.VALUATION.v1

"Set up automatic expiry-based markdown rules for fresh produce"
→ Creates: Business rules stored in core_relationships
```

"Add food cost accounts, sales accounts, and expense accounts"
→ Creates: Multiple core_entities with entity_type='gl_account'

"Set up automatic posting rules for inventory transactions to food cost accounts"
→ Creates: core_relationships linking inventory to GL accounts
```

### **Universal Transactions**
```bash
"Create a journal entry to record $500 food cost from inventory usage"
→ Creates: universal_transactions with smart_code HERA.FIN.GL.TXN.ENTRY.v1

"Generate a profit and loss report for the current month"

## 🔧 **MCP Commands for Universal Sales Module**

### **Sales Order Processing**
```bash
"Create a universal sales order for customer table 5 with 2 burgers and 1 fries"
→ Creates: Sales order with smart_code HERA.SALES.ORDER.CREATE.v1

"Add a customer entity for repeat customer John Smith with credit limit $1000"
→ Creates: Customer entity with smart_code HERA.SALES.CUST.SETUP.v1

"Process order fulfillment and generate delivery notification"
→ Creates: Fulfillment transaction with smart_code HERA.SALES.ORDER.FULFILL.v1
```

---

## 🧮 **MCP Commands for Universal Costing Module**

### **Recipe Costing**
```bash
"Create a recipe cost calculation for beef burger with ingredients and labor"
→ Creates: Recipe entity with cost breakdown smart_code HERA.COST.RECIPE.v1

"Set up activity-based costing for kitchen operations and front-of-house"
→ Creates: Cost centers with smart_code HERA.COST.ABC.SETUP.v1

"Generate a menu profitability analysis showing cost vs selling price"
→ Creates: Profitability report with smart_code HERA.PROF.ANAL.PRODUCT.v1
```

---

## 🔍 **Real-Time Architecture Compliance**

### **Automatic SACRED Rules Enforcement**
```bash
# Every MCP command automatically:
✅ Validates organization_id is present (multi-tenant isolation)
✅ Uses only universal tables (no custom schemas)
✅ Generates proper smart codes (business intelligence)
✅ Enforces universal patterns (reusability)
✅ Tracks compliance score in real-time

"validate-architecture for the sales order I just created"
→ Returns: 100% compliant, uses universal patterns, ready for reuse
```

### **Build Formula Tracking**
```bash
"check-hera-formula progress after inventory module development"
→ Returns: 
UT: 100% ✅ (Universal Tables complete)
UA: 100% ✅ (Universal API complete)  
UUI: 85% 🔄 (Components mature)
SC: 45% 📈 (Smart Codes growing with each module)
BM: 200% 🚀 (Business Modules accelerating)
IA: 33% 🎯 (Industry Apps planned)
Overall: 85% - DEPLOYMENT APPROVED! 🎉
```

## 🏭 **MCP Commands for Industry Specialization**

### **Restaurant Builder (Using Universal Foundation)**
```bash
"Create a restaurant POS system using the universal sales and inventory modules"
→ Reuses: Universal sales orders + inventory tracking
→ Adds: Table management, kitchen tickets, split billing
→ Smart codes: HERA.REST.POS.ORDER.v1 (extends HERA.SALES.ORDER.CREATE.v1)

"Add menu engineering analysis using universal costing and profitability"
→ Reuses: Universal recipe costing + profitability analysis  
→ Adds: Menu mix analysis, price optimization
→ Smart codes: HERA.REST.MENU.ENGINEER.v1 (extends HERA.PROF.ANAL.PRODUCT.v1)
```

### **Healthcare Builder (Using Universal Foundation)**
```bash
"Create a healthcare inventory system using universal inventory with lot tracking"
→ Reuses: Universal inventory + FIFO valuation
→ Adds: Lot tracking, expiry monitoring, regulatory compliance
→ Smart codes: HERA.HLTH.INV.LOT.v1 (extends HERA.INV.ITEM.TRACK.v1)

"Set up patient billing using universal billing with insurance integration"
→ Reuses: Universal invoice processing + AR management

## ⚡ **Speed Comparison: Traditional vs MCP**

### **Traditional Development**
```bash
# Restaurant Inventory Module:
Week 1: Design database schema
Week 2: Create API endpoints  
Week 3: Build UI components
Week 4: Implement business logic
Week 5: Add valuation methods
Week 6: Create reports
Week 7: Testing and debugging
Week 8: Documentation

Total: 8 weeks, 320 hours, $50K development cost
```

### **MCP-Powered Development**
```bash
# Universal Inventory Module:
Day 1: "Create universal inventory system with FIFO valuation"
Day 2: "Add receiving, issuing, and adjustment transactions"  
Day 3: "Set up valuation methods and revaluation processing"
Day 4: "Generate inventory reports and analytics"
Day 5: "Create restaurant-specific enhancements"

Total: 5 days, 40 hours, $5K development cost
Result: 90% time savings, 90% cost savings, infinite reusability
```
