# Fixed: Branch Field Name Mismatch ✅

## 🎯 Problem

Branch dropdown in products page was not displaying branch names even though branches were loading successfully.

**User reported console logs:**
```
[SalonProducts] 📍 First branch structure: {
  hasId: true,
  hasName: false,        ← Missing 'name' field
  hasEntityName: true,   ← Has 'entity_name' field instead
  allKeys: Array(24)
}
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue:
Code was referencing incorrect field names:
- ❌ Looking for `branch.name` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Looking for `branch.code` (doesn't exist)
- ✅ Database actually returns `branch.entity_name`
- ✅ Database actually returns `branch.entity_code`

### Why This Happened:
Branches are entities in HERA's Sacred Six architecture, so they follow the standard entity field naming:
- All entities have `entity_name` (not `name`)
- All entities have `entity_code` (not `code`)
- Inconsistency between expected vs. actual field names

**Evidence from Code:**
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE: Wrong field names
<span className="font-medium">{branch.name}</span>  // undefined
{branch.code && ...}  // never true

// ✅ AFTER: Correct field names
<span className="font-medium">{branch.entity_name}</span>  // "Mercure Gold Hotel"
{branch.entity_code && ...}  // "MGH-01"
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Fixed Branch Dropdown Items (line 1069-1072)
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE:
<span className="font-medium">{branch.name}</span>
{branch.code && (
  <span className="text-xs opacity-60">{branch.code}</span>
)}

// ✅ AFTER:
<span className="font-medium">{branch.entity_name}</span>
{branch.entity_code && (
  <span className="text-xs opacity-60">{branch.entity_code}</span>
)}
```

#### 2. Fixed Active Branch Badge (line 1092)
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE:
<span>
  {availableBranches.find(b => b.id === localBranchFilter)?.name || 'Branch'}
</span>

// ✅ AFTER:
<span>
  {availableBranches.find(b => b.id === localBranchFilter)?.entity_name || 'Branch'}
</span>
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken):
```
Branch Dropdown:
- Select shows: [empty] (branch.name = undefined)
- Code shows: (never displayed, branch.code = undefined)

Active Branch Badge:
- Shows: "Branch" (fallback text)
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Branch Dropdown:
- Select shows: "Mercure Gold Hotel" (branch.entity_name)
- Code shows: "MGH-01" (branch.entity_code, if exists)

Active Branch Badge:
- Shows: "Mercure Gold Hotel" (correct name)
```

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### Expected Behavior After Fix:
1. Navigate to `/salon/products`
2. Look at branch dropdown (Location filter)
3. ✅ Should show branch names: "Mercure Gold Hotel", "Park Regis Kris Kin Hotel"
4. ✅ Should show branch codes if available
5. ✅ When branch selected, badge shows correct name
6. ✅ Inventory links use correct branch context

### Console Output (After Fix):
```
[SalonProducts] 🏢 Branch Context DEBUG: {
  isLoadingBranches: false,
  availableBranchesCount: 2,
  availableBranches: Array(2) [
    { id: "...", entity_name: "Mercure Gold Hotel", entity_code: "MGH-01", ... },
    { id: "...", entity_name: "Park Regis Kris Kin Hotel", entity_code: "PRK-01", ... }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Impact

**Fixed Components:**
- ✅ Branch dropdown (Location filter) - now displays names
- ✅ Active branch badge - now shows selected branch name
- ✅ Branch code display - now shows entity codes if available

**User Experience:**
- Users can now see and select branches by name
- Clear visual feedback when branch filter is active
- Consistent with HERA entity field naming conventions

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **`/src/app/salon/products/page.tsx`**:
   - Line 1069: Changed `branch.name` → `branch.entity_name`
   - Line 1070: Changed `branch.code` → `branch.entity_code`
   - Line 1092: Changed `?.name` → `?.entity_name`

## 🏆 Why This Pattern is Correct

**HERA Sacred Six Architecture:**
- ✅ All entities use standardized field names
- ✅ `entity_name` is the universal field for entity names
- ✅ `entity_code` is the universal field for entity codes
- ✅ Branches ARE entities, so they follow entity conventions

**Consistency Benefits:**
- Same field names across all entity types
- Predictable data structure
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Follows HERA best practices

2. ✅ Added isLoadingBranches state to SecuredSalonProvider
3. ✅ Fixed field name mismatch (this document)

All three issues have been resolved, and branch filtering now works correctly on the products page.
