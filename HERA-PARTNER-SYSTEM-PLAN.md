# HERA Partner System - Complete Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Meta Breakthrough: Using HERA to Build HERA's Partner System

We'll use HERA's own universal 6-table architecture to build and manage our partner ecosystem. This proves HERA can handle ANY business model, including complex partner management.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: System Architecture (Using Universal Tables)

### 1.1 Partner Entity Design
```sql
-- Partners are just entities in core_entities
entity_type: 'partner'
entity_code: 'PARTNER-{UNIQUE_ID}'
smart_code: 'HERA.PARTNER.ENT.PROFILE.v1'

-- Partner metadata includes:
{
  "partner_type": "implementation|reseller|referral|white_label",
  "tier": "silver|gold|platinum", 
  "revenue_share": 50,
  "certification_status": "pending|certified|expert",
  "specializations": ["manufacturing", "retail", "healthcare"],
  "geographic_coverage": ["US", "Canada", "UK"]
}
```

### 1.2 Customer-Partner Relationships
```sql
-- Use core_relationships to link customers to partners
relationship_type: 'managed_by_partner'
source_entity_id: {customer_id}
target_entity_id: {partner_id}
metadata: {
  "relationship_start": "2024-01-01",
  "revenue_share_percent": 50,
  "support_level": "tier_1|tier_2|tier_3"
}
```

### 1.3 Partner Revenue Tracking
```sql
-- Use universal_transactions for commission tracking
transaction_type: 'partner_commission'
transaction_subtype: 'monthly_recurring'
metadata: {
  "customer_id": "{customer_id}",
  "partner_id": "{partner_id}",
  "customer_mrr": 249.00,
  "partner_share": 124.50,
  "commission_month": "2024-03"
