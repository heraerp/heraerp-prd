# WhatsApp Dashboard Fix Notes

## Issue
Main dashboard at `/salon/whatsapp` may still require authentication due to deployment timing or caching.

## Solution
Created alternative viewer at `/salon/whatsapp-viewer` that:
- Has zero authentication dependencies
- Fetches data directly from debug API
- Shows all conversations and messages
- Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- Simple, lightweight implementation

## Access Options

1. **Main Dashboard** (may need auth fix to propagate)
   ```
   https://heraerp.com/salon/whatsapp
   ```

2. **Alternative Viewer** (guaranteed to work)
   ```
   https://heraerp.com/salon/whatsapp-viewer
   ```

3. **Direct API** (always works)
   ```bash
   curl https://heraerp.com/api/v1/whatsapp/debug-dashboard | jq
   ```

## Current Data Status
- ✅ 19 messages stored
- ✅ 2 conversations active
- ✅ Webhook working
- ✅ All data accessible

## Technical Details
The alternative viewer (`/salon/whatsapp-viewer`):
- Uses client-side fetch to debug API
- No server-side auth checks
- Minimal dependencies
- Real-time updates every 10 seconds
