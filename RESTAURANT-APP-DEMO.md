## 🏗️ Universal Architecture in Action

### The Sacred 6 Tables (Used As-Is)
This restaurant system uses HERA's universal schema without any modifications:

1. **`core_organizations`** → Restaurant locations/franchises
2. **`core_entities`** → Menu items, customers, staff, tables, suppliers
3. **`core_dynamic_data`** → Prices, ingredients, dietary info, preferences
4. **`core_relationships`** → Recipes, favorites, table assignments
5. **`universal_transactions`** → Orders, payments, purchases, payroll
6. **`universal_transaction_lines`** → Order items, payment details

### Universal Data Mapping Examples

#### 🍝 Menu Items (via core_entities)
```sql
entity_type: "menu_item"
entity_name: "Margherita Pizza"
entity_code: "PIZZA_MARG"

-- Dynamic properties in core_dynamic_data:
price: "18.50"
ingredients: "Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil"
dietary_tags: ["vegetarian", "gluten_free_option"]
prep_time: "12"
category: "pizza"
```

#### 🛒 Customer Orders (via universal_transactions)
```sql
transaction_type: "order"
reference_number: "ORD-2024-001"
total_amount: 45.50

-- Order items in universal_transaction_lines:
line_type: "order_item"
entity_id: pizza_margherita_id
quantity: 1
unit_price: 18.50
modifications: ["gluten_free_crust"]
```
