# Cross‑module considerations
notes: |
  - This manufacturing module complements the Supply Chain module by
    providing the upstream capabilities for production and quality
    management.  Together they enable end‑to‑end fulfilment from
    planning through production, warehousing and delivery.
  - AI and real‑time data are pervasive across all areas, enabling
    simulations, demand forecasting, production monitoring and
    quality inspections that improve decision‑making and operational
    efficiency【791993650159193†L33-L48】.
