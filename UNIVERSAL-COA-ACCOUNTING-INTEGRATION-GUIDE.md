## üèóÔ∏è **UNIVERSAL ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATION**

### **The Sacred 6-Table Pattern**
Every business, regardless of industry, uses exactly the same universal foundation:

```typescript
// UNIVERSAL TABLES - Handle ANY Business Type
core_organizations        ‚Üí Multi-tenant business isolation
core_entities            ‚Üí ALL business objects (GL accounts, customers, products)
core_dynamic_data         ‚Üí Schema-less custom fields for any industry
core_relationships       ‚Üí Universal business connections and hierarchies  
universal_transactions   ‚Üí ALL business activities (sales, purchases, labor)
universal_transaction_lines ‚Üí Transaction details and line-item breakdowns
```

### **Smart Code Classification System**
Universal pattern that adapts to any industry:

```typescript
// Pattern: HERA.{INDUSTRY}.{MODULE}.{FUNCTION}.{TYPE}.v{VERSION}

// Restaurant Example (Mario's Implementation)
HERA.REST.SALE.ORDER.v1        ‚Üí Food sales with tax allocation
HERA.REST.COGS.FOOD.v1         ‚Üí Food cost posting with inventory reduction
HERA.REST.LABOR.KITCHEN.v1     ‚Üí Kitchen staff labor allocation

// Healthcare Pattern (Same Architecture)
HERA.HLTH.PATIENT.VISIT.v1     ‚Üí Patient consultation revenue
HERA.HLTH.COGS.MEDICAL.v1      ‚Üí Medical supplies cost allocation
HERA.HLTH.LABOR.CLINICAL.v1    ‚Üí Clinical staff labor tracking

// Manufacturing Pattern (Same Architecture)
HERA.MFG.PRODUCTION.ORDER.v1   ‚Üí Work order processing
HERA.MFG.COGS.MATERIAL.v1      ‚Üí Material cost with BOM integration
HERA.MFG.LABOR.PRODUCTION.v1   ‚Üí Production line labor allocation

// The SAME posting logic works across ALL industries! üöÄ

## üí∞ **UNIVERSAL COSTING INTEGRATION**

### **Industry-Agnostic Cost Allocation**
The same costing principles apply across ALL industries:

#### **Restaurant Costing (Mario's Implementation)**
```typescript
Order Revenue: $89.50
- Food Costs: $28.75 (32.1%)
- Labor Costs: $18.50 (20.7%)  
- Overhead: $12.25 (13.7%)
= Gross Profit: $30.00 (33.5%)
```

#### **Healthcare Costing (Same Pattern)**
```typescript
Patient Visit: $150.00
- Medical Supplies: $25.00 (16.7%)
- Clinical Labor: $45.00 (30.0%)
- Facility Overhead: $20.00 (13.3%)
= Gross Profit: $60.00 (40.0%)
```

#### **Manufacturing Costing (Same Pattern)**  
```typescript
Product Sale: $2,500.00
- Material Costs: $1,250.00 (50.0%)
- Direct Labor: $500.00 (20.0%)
- Manufacturing Overhead: $250.00 (10.0%)

```

#### **Professional Services Costing (Same Pattern)**
```typescript
Project Billing: $8,000.00
- Direct Labor: $4,800.00 (60.0%)
- Subcontractor: $1,000.00 (12.5%)
- Project Overhead: $800.00 (10.0%)

```

### **Universal Waste/Loss Allocation**
Every industry has waste that must be tracked and allocated:

```sql
-- Restaurant: Food waste posting
DR: 5500 (Food Waste Expense)
CR: 1300 (Food Inventory)

-- Healthcare: Medical supply waste
DR: 5920 (Medical Waste Disposal)  
CR: 1310 (Medical Supplies)
