# CivicFlow Gap Analysis - Missing Features to Meet Access Requirements

## Current Implementation Status âœ…
We have successfully implemented:
- **Programs Module**: Complete with KPIs, filtering, grant rounds, export functionality
- **Organizations Module**: Basic CRM functionality
- **Authentication Flow**: Multi-tenant with demo support
- **Professional Theme**: Deep Navy & Vibrant Teal color scheme

## Missing Critical Modules

### ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY - MUST HAVE

#### 1. **Grants Application System** (REQ-G2-01 to REQ-G2-04)
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Create Application with partner profile (strategy, impact, matching finance, EDI)
- Co-development workspace for joint drafting & file exchange with versioning
- Stage progression (1â€“4), gate reviews, decision reasons, partner notifications
- Benchmark application against similar funds/objectives/size

**Implementation Needed**:
```typescript
// Modules to build:
- /civicflow/grants/applications/new
- /civicflow/grants/applications/[id]
- /civicflow/grants/applications/[id]/collaboration
- /civicflow/grants/applications/[id]/stages
- /civicflow/grants/benchmarking
```

#### 2. **Cases Management System** (REQ-G3-01 to REQ-G3-05)
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Store signed agreement with e-signature status and key contacts
- Capture draw-down schedule and bank details with permissions
- Track monitoring KPIs including IMD coverage; RAG ratings; dashboards
- Variations/waivers/breaches/extensions workflow with approvals and audit
- Quarterly committee reporting pack (due diligence, RAG)

**Implementation Needed**:
```typescript
// Modules to build:
- /civicflow/cases/agreements
- /civicflow/cases/[id]/drawdowns
- /civicflow/cases/[id]/monitoring
- /civicflow/cases/[id]/variations
- /civicflow/cases/reporting
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Programs Module** (REQ-G1-01 to REQ-G1-03)
**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Missing Features**:
- Program concept, outcomes, funding type, governance details
- Consultation logging (roundtables, submissions, meetings, visits, case studies)
- File management and document versioning
- Programme shaping history and historic programme retention

**Implementation Needed**:
```typescript
// Features to add to existing Programs:
- /civicflow/programs/[id]/consultations
- /civicflow/programs/[id]/documents
- /civicflow/programs/[id]/history
- /civicflow/programs/[id]/governance
```

#### 4. **Financial Processing System** (REQ-G4-01 to REQ-G4-03)
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Payment request â†’ approval â†’ execution within 10-day SLA
- Weekly payment cycles; alerts for upcoming payments
- GL coding on draw-down lines (GL, cost centre, project)

**Implementation Needed**:
```typescript
// Modules to build:
- /civicflow/finance/payments/requests
- /civicflow/finance/payments/approvals
- /civicflow/finance/payments/execution
- /civicflow/finance/gl-coding
```

### ðŸ“‹ MEDIUM PRIORITY - SHOULD HAVE

#### 5. **Calendar Integration**
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**: Integration with Programs for consultation scheduling

#### 6. **Playbooks Integration**
**Status**: EXISTS IN HERA BUT NOT CIVICFLOW
**Requirements**: Workflow automation for grant processes

#### 7. **Advanced Reporting**
**Status**: BASIC EXPORT ONLY
**Requirements**: 
- Committee reporting packs
- Due diligence reports
- RAG status dashboards

## Implementation Priority Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Grant Management (4-6 weeks)
1. **Grants Application System**
   - Application creation and partner profiles
   - Stage progression workflow
   - Basic collaboration workspace

2. **Enhanced Programs Module**
   - Consultation logging
   - Document management
   - Programme history

### Phase 2: Case Management (3-4 weeks)
1. **Cases Management System**
   - Agreement storage and e-signature tracking
   - Draw-down scheduling
   - KPI monitoring with RAG ratings

### Phase 3: Financial Integration (2-3 weeks)
1. **Financial Processing**
   - Payment request workflow
   - Approval systems
   - GL coding integration

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
1. **Benchmarking and Analytics**
2. **Advanced Reporting**
3. **Committee reporting packs**

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### Database Extensions Needed
All following HERA Six Tables architecture:

```sql
-- New Entity Types Required:
- grant_application
- case_agreement
- consultation_event
- payment_request
- rag_status
- benchmark_metric

-- New Smart Code Families:
HERA.CIVICFLOW.GRANTS.*
HERA.CIVICFLOW.CASES.*
HERA.CIVICFLOW.CONSULTATIONS.*
HERA.CIVICFLOW.PAYMENTS.*
```

### API Endpoints to Build

```

## Estimated Development Time

**Total Implementation**: 11-16 weeks
- Phase 1: 4-6 weeks (Grants & Enhanced Programs)
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks (Cases Management)
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks (Financial Processing)
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks (Advanced Features)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start with Grants Application System as it's the most critical missing piece
2. **Week 2**: Begin Cases Management planning while Grants is in development
3. **Parallel**: Enhance existing Programs module with consultation and document features
4. **Final**: Integrate Financial Processing and Advanced Reporting
