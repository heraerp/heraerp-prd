## 🏗️ **Universal Architecture Foundation**

### **The Sacred 6-Table Pattern**
Every business, regardless of industry, uses exactly the same foundation:

```sql
core_organizations        -- Multi-tenant business isolation
core_entities            -- ALL business objects (customers, products, GL accounts)
core_dynamic_data         -- Schema-less custom fields for any industry  
core_relationships       -- Universal business connections and hierarchies
universal_transactions   -- ALL business activities (sales, purchases, labor)
universal_transaction_lines -- Transaction details and line-item breakdowns
```

### **Smart Code Intelligence**
Universal pattern that adapts to any industry:
```typescript
HERA.REST.SALE.ORDER.v1        // Restaurant food sales
HERA.HLTH.PATIENT.VISIT.v1     // Healthcare consultations
HERA.MFG.PRODUCTION.ORDER.v1   // Manufacturing work orders
HERA.PROF.TIME.BILLING.v1      // Professional services billing
```
