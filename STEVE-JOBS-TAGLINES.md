"HERA is a revolutionary ERP platform built on a universal 6-table architecture that eliminates schema changes and provides infinite scalability through dynamic data modeling and smart code generation."

**After (Customer-Focused)**:
"Run your entire business in one beautiful platform. From day one to enterprise scale."

**Result**: Same powerful capabilities, but now anyone can understand why they should care in 3 seconds instead of 3 minutes.
