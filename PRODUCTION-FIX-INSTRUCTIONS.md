# 🚨 PRODUCTION FIX - Environment Variable Update

## 🎯 Root Cause Found

The production authentication loop is caused by **incorrect organization ID** in environment variables.

### **Problem:**
- **Production ENV**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID=f0af4ced-9d12-4a55-a649-b484368db249`
- **User exists in**: `378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8`

The frontend tries to authenticate the user in an organization where they don't exist!

## 🔧 Required Fix

### **Update Production Environment Variable:**

```bash
# In your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify/etc), update:
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID=378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8
```

### **Verification Steps:**

1. **Update the environment variable** in your hosting platform
2. **Redeploy** the application 
3. **Test** by accessing https://heraerp.com/salon/dashboard
4. **Expected result**: Authentication should complete without the loading loop

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Database State (Verified Correct):**
- ✅ Production user `09b0b92a-d797-489e-bc03-5ca0a6272674` exists
- ✅ USER entity exists in organization `378f24fb-d496-4ff7-8afa-ea34895a0eb8` 
- ✅ MEMBER_OF relationship is correct and active
- ✅ Points to proper ORG entity

### **Frontend Issue:**
- ❌ Environment points to wrong organization ID
- ❌ Frontend tries to resolve user in non-existent organization
- ❌ Gets stuck in "Resolving user entity" loop

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

After updating the environment variable:

1. **Production user can log in** successfully 
2. **No more loading loops** 
3. **Dashboard loads normally**
4. **All authentication flows work** as intended

## 🔄 Alternative Quick Fix

If you can't update environment variables immediately, you can also **create the user in the ENV organization**, but updating the environment variable is the proper fix.

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Single line fix**: Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID` from `f0af4ced...` to `378f24fb...` in production environment.

This will **immediately resolve** the production authentication loop issue! 🚀
