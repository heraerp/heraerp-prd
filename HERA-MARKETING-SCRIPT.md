## üìä ROI CALCULATOR SCRIPT

### **Cost Comparison**
*"Let me show you the real numbers:"*

- **Traditional ERP**: $2.9M implementation + $500K annual licensing = $3.4M first year
- **HERA**: $50K setup + $50K annual subscription = $100K first year
- **Your Savings**: $3.3M in year one alone

*"That's a 97% cost reduction. What could you do with an extra $3.3M?"*

### **Time Value**
*"Your competitors will spend the next 18 months implementing their ERP. You'll be serving customers and generating revenue from day one. At $100K monthly revenue, that's $1.8M in lost opportunity cost they'll never recover."*

---

## üéØ OBJECTION HANDLING

### **"It sounds too good to be true"**
*"I understand the skepticism. Everyone promises easy ERP implementations. But here's the difference - HERA is built on a revolutionary universal architecture. Instead of forcing your business into rigid modules, we built one system that adapts to any business model. It's not magic - it's just better engineering."*

### **"What about customization?"**
*"Traditional ERPs make you choose: out-of-the-box limitations or expensive custom development. HERA eliminates that choice. Our universal architecture handles any business complexity without code changes. You get both - simplicity AND customization."*

### **"How do you make money at these prices?"**
*"Volume and efficiency. While competitors have armies of consultants billing hourly rates, we've automated what used to require human intervention. Our technology does in seconds what used to take consultants months."*

### **"What about data migration?"**
*"We've never met a data source we couldn't migrate. Excel, QuickBooks, Salesforce, SAP - doesn't matter. Our universal architecture accepts any data format. Most migrations complete overnight."*

## üöÄ CLOSING SEQUENCES

### **Soft Close**

### **Urgency Close**
*"We're only taking 50 new clients this quarter to ensure quality. After that, there's a waiting list. Would you like to secure one of the remaining spots?"*

### **ROI Close**
*"At $3.3M in first-year savings, HERA pays for itself in the first month. Even if you only capture 10% of those savings, you're still ahead by $330K. What's the downside of trying?"*

### **Free Trial Close**
*"Let's eliminate all the risk. Start your free prototype today. If you don't love it in 30 days, walk away. But I'm betting that once you see HERA in action, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it."*
