## 🏗️ Implementation Architecture

### 1. RBAC Configuration Module
**File:** `src/lib/auth/salon-rbac.ts`

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
hasPageAccess(role: SalonRole, path: string): boolean
  // Check if role can access a specific page

getAccessiblePages(role: SalonRole): PageAccessRule[]
  // Get all pages a role can access

getRestrictedPages(role: SalonRole): PageAccessRule[]
  // Get all pages a role cannot access

getDefaultPath(role: SalonRole): string
  // Get default redirect path for role

getAccessDeniedMessage(role: SalonRole, path: string): string
  // Get user-friendly access denied message
```

**Page Access Rule Structure:**
```typescript
interface PageAccessRule {
  path: string            // Route path (e.g., '/salon/dashboard')
  allowedRoles: SalonRole[]  // Roles that can access
  description: string     // Human-readable description
}
```

---

### 2. Client-Side Route Guard
**File:** `src/components/auth/SalonRouteGuard.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Checks authentication status
- ✅ Validates organization context
- ✅ Verifies role permissions
- ✅ Shows loading state during check
- ✅ Displays access denied screen
- ✅ Auto-redirects after 3 seconds
- ✅ Provides manual redirect button

**Usage:**
```tsx
<SalonRouteGuard>
  <YourPageContent />
</SalonRouteGuard>
```

**Access Denied Screen:**
- Shows shield icon
- Displays user role badge
- Explains why access is denied
- Shows countdown timer (3s)
- Provides "Go to Dashboard" button

---

### 3. Layout Integration
**File:** `src/app/salon/layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
```tsx
// Wraps all salon pages (except public pages)
<SalonRouteGuard>
  <SalonLayoutContent>{children}</SalonLayoutContent>
</SalonRouteGuard>
```

**Public Pages (No Guard):**
- `/salon` - Landing page
- `/salon/auth` - Auth page
- `/salon-access` - Login page
- `/salon/login` - Login page
- `/salon/reset-password` - Password reset

---

## 🔄 Authentication Flow with RBAC

```
1. User logs in via /salon-access
   ↓
2. Supabase authenticates user
   ↓
3. hera_auth_introspect_v1 resolves role (ORG_OWNER | ORG_EMPLOYEE)
   ↓
4. Role mapped to salon role (owner | receptionist)
   ↓
5. Role stored in localStorage
   ↓
6. User redirected based on role
   ↓
7. SalonRouteGuard checks permissions on every navigation
   ↓
8. If authorized: Show page
   If unauthorized: Show access denied → Redirect to default page
```

**Test:** Change user role and verify access updates

**Steps:**
1. Login as receptionist
2. Verify can only access POS/appointments
3. Logout

  allowedRoles: ['owner', 'manager'],
  description: 'New Page Description'
}
```

2. The route guard automatically enforces the rule

---

### Changing Page Permissions
1. Find the page in `SALON_PAGE_ACCESS` array
2. Update `allowedRoles` array:
```typescript
// Before: Only owner
allowedRoles: ['owner']

// After: Owner and manager
allowedRoles: ['owner', 'manager']
```

3. Restart dev server to apply changes

---

### Adding a New Role
1. Update `SalonRole` type:
```typescript
export type SalonRole = 'owner' | 'manager' | 'receptionist' | 'accountant' | 'supervisor'
```

2. Add default path:
```typescript
const defaultPaths: Record<SalonRole, string> = {
  // ... existing roles
  supervisor: '/salon/supervisor'
}
```

3. Add access denied message:
```typescript
const messages: Record<SalonRole, string> = {
  // ... existing roles
  supervisor: 'Supervisors can access...'
}
```

4. Update page access rules with new role

---
