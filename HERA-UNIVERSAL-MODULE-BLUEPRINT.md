# 🏗️ HERA Universal Module Development Blueprint

## 📚 How to Build Any Industry Module Using the 9-Phase Framework

This blueprint shows how to adapt the proven HERA Furniture Module approach for ANY industry. The same 9-phase process, same universal architecture, same revolutionary results.

---

## 🎯 The Universal 9-Phase Framework

### Phase 1: Smart Code Registry (Foundation)
**Purpose**: Define your industry's classification system

**Universal Pattern**:
```javascript
HERA.{INDUSTRY}.{DOMAIN}.{TYPE}.{SUBTYPE}.v{VERSION}

Examples:
- Furniture: HERA.FURN.PROD.TABLE.DINING.v1
- Healthcare: HERA.HLTH.PAT.RECORD.MEDICAL.v1
- Restaurant: HERA.REST.MENU.ITEM.ENTREE.v1
- Retail: HERA.RETL.INV.PRODUCT.CLOTHING.v1
```

**Industry Adaptation Checklist**:
- [ ] Define 40-60 smart codes covering all business objects
- [ ] Create classification hierarchy
- [ ] Include transaction types
- [ ] Add workflow states
- [ ] Document in `{industry}-smart-codes-registry.js`

### Phase 2: User Interfaces (High Priority)
**Purpose**: Build industry-specific visualization components

**Universal Components to Adapt**:
1. **Explorer/Browser** (like BOM Explorer)
   - Healthcare: Patient Record Browser
   - Restaurant: Menu Category Explorer
   - Retail: Product Catalog Browser

2. **Relationship Manager** (like Supplier Relationships)
   - Healthcare: Doctor-Patient Assignments
   - Restaurant: Table-Waiter Assignments
   - Retail: Customer-Product Preferences

3. **Dashboard** (like Manufacturing Dashboard)
   - Healthcare: Patient Flow Dashboard
   - Restaurant: Kitchen Order Dashboard
   - Retail: Sales Performance Dashboard

### Phase 3: Entity Catalog (Foundation)
**Purpose**: Define core business entities

**Universal Entity Types**:
```javascript
// Base Pattern (adapt names to industry)
1. Primary Entity (Product → Patient/Menu Item/SKU)
2. Customer Entity (Customer → Patient/Diner/Shopper)
3. Supplier Entity (Supplier → Provider/Vendor/Distributor)
4. Location Entity (Warehouse → Clinic/Restaurant/Store)
5. Resource Entity (Machine → Equipment/Table/Register)
6. Document Entity (Order → Prescription/Check/Receipt)
7. Financial Entity (GL Account - same for all)
```

### Phase 4: Dynamic Data Definitions (Foundation)
**Purpose**: Define custom fields without schema changes

**Industry-Specific Dynamic Fields Examples**:

**Healthcare**:
- Patient: blood_type, allergies, emergency_contact, insurance_id
- Provider: specialization, license_number, hospital_privileges
- Appointment: symptoms, diagnosis_codes, treatment_plan

**Restaurant**:
- Menu Item: calories, allergens, prep_time, spice_level
- Table: capacity, section, view_type, reservation_status
- Order: special_instructions, dietary_restrictions, course_timing

**Retail**:
- Product: size, color, material, care_instructions
- Store: square_footage, parking_spaces, store_hours
- Customer: loyalty_tier, preferred_brands, sizes

### Phase 5: Relationship Graph (Foundation)
**Purpose**: Map how entities connect

**Universal Relationship Patterns**:
```javascript
// Hierarchical (Parent-Child)
- Healthcare: Department → Doctors → Patients
- Restaurant: Menu Category → Items → Ingredients
- Retail: Department → Category → Products

// Many-to-Many
- Healthcare: Doctors ↔ Patients (appointments)
- Restaurant: Tables ↔ Orders (service)
- Retail: Customers ↔ Products (purchases)

// Workflow (Status-based)
- Healthcare: Admitted → In Treatment → Discharged
- Restaurant: Ordered → Preparing → Ready → Served
- Retail: Browsing → In Cart → Purchased → Shipped
```

### Phase 6: Universal Configuration Rules (UCR)
**Purpose**: Implement business logic as data

**Industry-Specific Rule Categories**:

**Healthcare**:
- Validation: Insurance eligibility, prescription interactions
- Approval: Treatment authorization, referral requirements
- Scheduling: Appointment slots, resource availability
- Compliance: HIPAA rules, consent requirements

**Restaurant**:
- Validation: Inventory availability, allergy warnings
- Pricing: Happy hour, combo meals, loyalty discounts
- Kitchen: Prep sequences, cooking times, station routing
- Service: Table turnover, reservation rules

**Retail**:
- Validation: Stock levels, purchase limits
- Pricing: Sale prices, bulk discounts, member pricing
- Inventory: Reorder points, transfer rules
- Promotions: BOGO, coupons, loyalty rewards

### Phase 7: Universal Transactions
**Purpose**: Implement core business workflows

**Industry Transaction Types**:

**Healthcare**:
```javascript
- Patient Registration (patient_admission)
- Appointment Booking (appointment_schedule)
- Treatment Record (treatment_service)
- Prescription Order (prescription_order)
- Insurance Claim (insurance_claim)
```

**Restaurant**:
```javascript
- Table Reservation (reservation)
- Customer Order (food_order)
- Kitchen Ticket (kitchen_order)
- Payment Processing (payment)
- Inventory Usage (ingredient_consumption)
```

**Retail**:
```javascript
- Customer Purchase (sales_transaction)
- Inventory Receipt (stock_receipt)
- Stock Transfer (inventory_transfer)
- Return Processing (customer_return)
- Loyalty Transaction (loyalty_point)
```

### Phase 8: Performance & Scale
**Purpose**: Optimize for industry-specific volumes

**Industry-Specific Optimizations**:

**Healthcare**:
- Cache: Patient records, provider schedules
- Batch: Insurance claim processing, lab results
- Index: Patient ID, appointment dates
- Monitor: Wait times, bed utilization

**Restaurant**:
- Cache: Menu items, table layouts
- Batch: End-of-day sales, inventory depletion
- Index: Order time, table number
- Monitor: Kitchen times, table turnover

**Retail**:
- Cache: Product catalog, pricing rules
- Batch: Inventory updates, loyalty points
- Index: SKU, customer ID
- Monitor: Transaction speed, stock levels

### Phase 9: Finance DNA Integration
**Purpose**: Connect to universal accounting

**Universal Integration** (same for all industries):
- Automatic GL posting
- Industry-specific COA templates
- Transaction-to-journal mapping
- Financial reporting

## 🎯 Key Principles for Success

1. **Think Universal First**
   - Use existing entity types before creating new ones
   - Store custom data in dynamic fields
   - Express logic as UCR rules, not code

2. **Follow the Smart Code Pattern**
   - Every entity needs a smart code
   - Every transaction needs classification
   - Every relationship has meaning

3. **Build on the Foundation**
   - Reuse universal components
   - Adapt UI patterns from furniture module
   - Copy UCR rule structures

4. **Maintain Simplicity**
   - If you need schema changes, rethink the approach
   - If logic is in code, move it to UCR
   - If performance suffers, add caching
