# Icon Fixes Summary

## Runtime Errors Fixed

### 1. Template Icon Error
- **File**: `/src/app/salon-data/page.tsx` (line 918)
- **Error**: `Template is not defined`
- **Fix**: Replaced `Template` with `FileText` icon
- **Context**: Business Rule Templates card

### 2. CheckCircle Icon Error
- **File**: `/src/app/salon-data/page.tsx` (line 1175)
- **Error**: `CheckCircle is not defined`
- **Fix**: Replaced `CheckCircle` with `UserCheck` icon
- **Context**: Active Rules section

## Root Cause
The icons `Template` and `CheckCircle` were used in the component but were not imported from the lucide-react library. Both icons were replaced with similar icons that were already imported.

## Prevention
To prevent similar errors in the future:
1. Always verify that icons are imported before using them
2. Use TypeScript's auto-import feature in VS Code
3. Run a build before pushing to catch undefined references

## Build Status
A production build has been initiated to verify no other undefined references exist in the codebase.
